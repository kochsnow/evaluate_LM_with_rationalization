Poisonous gas is a type of gas that is known to cause death through exposure to its fumes, which are typically produced in large quantities and stored in underground or buried storage facilities. Gases such as mustard gas, radon, cyanide, sulfur, and arsenic were commonly used during the war, and both sides in the conflict used it to cause death. Since then, there have been several major international agreements that have been adopted as a global agreement to ban the use of certain types of gas in order to improve the safety and health of the United States and other countries have adopted the use of gas as a tactic in order to reduce the risk of exposure to toxic or dangerous weapons, and the production and storage of weapons and other substances that could be used to a variety of weapons and chemical weapons.<extra_id_1> </s>\n",
