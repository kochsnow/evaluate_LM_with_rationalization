He decided to build an unattached building in his backyard. Building an unattached building was a great solution for James because it allowed him to give his children a safe place to play without taking up too much space in his home.\n\nThe unattached building gave James a great deal of flexibility in terms of design and construction. He was able to make the playroom as large or as small as he wanted and he could customize it to meet the needs of his children. He could also choose the materials he wanted to use, from lumber to drywall, to make sure that the playroom would be safe and durable.\n\nThe unattached building also gave James the freedom to build the playroom close to where his children would use it. He didn't have to worry about adding on to his home or taking up floor space. He could build the playroom right in his backyard, so his children could easily access it.\n\nSince the playroom was located outside, James was also able to ensure that his children had plenty of fresh air and natural light. He could also install windows in the playroom to allow even more natural light to come in during the day. This would help his children stay healthy and active.\n\nOverall, building an unattached building for his children's playroom was a great decision for James. It allowed him to customize the playroom to meet his children's needs, while also making sure that it was close to where they would use it. It also provided plenty of fresh air and natural light, which helped to keep his children healthy and active. Building an unattached building was a great solution for James and his family."}
