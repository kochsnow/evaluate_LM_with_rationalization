{"stem": "Given question: He ordered his men to go forth and drive the enemy which way? and answer: backwards, explain why in", "no_more_50_words": "When one drives away the enemy, the goal is to keep them from advancing forward and claiming more land, instead sending them back the way they came.", "id": "ca94a7a2db2427000631de54f68f251f", "more_than_250": "\n\nHe ordered his men to go forth and drive the enemy backwards for two main reasons. The first is to achieve an advantageous position in the battle. By driving the enemy backwards, the attacking force can gain ground and push the enemy further away, creating a distance between the two forces. This can give the attacking force an advantage if they are able to gain ground and create a buffer between them and the enemy. If the enemy is pushed back far enough, they may not be able to rally their forces and launch a counterattack.\n\nThe second reason is to disrupt the enemy's strategy. By pushing the enemy backwards, the attacking force can break up any plans the enemy had in place and create chaos. This can be especially effective in a battle where the enemy is relying heavily on a specific strategy or plan of attack. By driving the enemy backwards, the attacking force can disrupt their plans and force them to change their tactics. This can give the attacking force an advantage as the enemy scrambles to adjust their strategy.\n\nFinally, driving the enemy backwards can also create an opportunity for the attacking force to launch a counterattack. By pushing the enemy back, the attacking force can create a hole in the enemy's defense and launch a surprise attack. This can be effective in catching the enemy off-guard and allowing the attacking force to gain an advantage in the battle.\n\nOverall, driving the enemy backwards can have numerous strategic benefits in a battle. By pushing the enemy back, the attacking force can gain ground, disrupt the enemy's strategy, and create an opportunity to launch a counterattack. These tactics can give the attacking force an advantage and increase the likelihood of success in the battle."}
