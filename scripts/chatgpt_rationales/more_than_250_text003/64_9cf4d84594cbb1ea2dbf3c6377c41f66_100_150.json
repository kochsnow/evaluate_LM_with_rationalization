{"stem": "Given question: A shark is stuck in a lake, where does it need to go provided it isn't a bull shark? and answer: saltwater, explain why in", "no_more_50_words": "most lakes are fresh water, sharks normally live in saltwater.", "id": "9cf4d84594cbb1ea2dbf3c6377c41f66", "more_than_250": "\n\nSharks need to live in saltwater in order to survive, so if a shark is stuck in a lake, it needs to find a way to get to a body of saltwater. Of course, if the shark isn't a bull shark, then it should be able to make it out of the lake. \n\nThe reason why a shark needs to live in saltwater is because it needs to maintain a certain ionic balance in its body in order to survive, and the salt content in saltwater helps it to do that. Sharks have special glands near their eyes and gills that help them to excrete excess salt, which is why they must be in saltwater in order to survive. \n\nIn addition to maintaining the proper ionic balance, saltwater also provides sharks with a number of other benefits. It is home to a wide variety of prey items, such as small fish, squid, and crustaceans. This provides the shark with a plentiful food supply, which is essential for its survival. \n\nSaltwater also helps the shark to regulate its body temperature. Sharks are cold-blooded animals, so they rely on the temperature of their environment to regulate their body temperature. Saltwater has a higher temperature than freshwater, so it can help the shark to maintain a comfortable body temperature. \n\nFinally, saltwater is important for sharks because it provides a more conducive environment for breeding and mating. Sharks typically migrate to areas with higher concentrations of saltwater in order to mate and reproduce. This is why the presence of saltwater is so important for the survival of the species. \n\nIn conclusion, if a shark is stuck in a lake, it needs to find a way to get to a body of saltwater in order to survive. Saltwater provides the shark with the necessary ionic balance, a plentiful food supply, a more conducive environment for breeding and mating, and a more comfortable body temperature. Therefore, it is absolutely essential for the survival of the shark."}
