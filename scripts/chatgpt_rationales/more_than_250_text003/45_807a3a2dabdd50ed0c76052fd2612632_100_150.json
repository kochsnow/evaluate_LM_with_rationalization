{"stem": "Given question: What do people do sometimes when they find a good deal? and answer: fight each other, explain why in", "no_more_50_words": "Malls sometimes have sales, e.g., on black friday, when they offer good deals; however, the items are sometimes in limited supply, which can cause altercations between folks, each trying to buy the same item.", "id": "807a3a2dabdd50ed0c76052fd2612632", "more_than_250": "\n\nWhen people find a good deal, they sometimes fight each other to get it. This is usually because it is a limited time offer or a one of a kind item, and people don't want to miss out. They may also be motivated by the fear of missing out, or FOMO.\n\nOne of the primary reasons people fight for a good deal is because it is a limited time offer or a one of a kind item. For example, if a store has a sale on an expensive item, people may fight each other to get it. This is because they know it won't last forever and they don't want to miss out.\n\nAnother factor that contributes to people fighting for a good deal is the fear of missing out, or FOMO. This is when people feel anxious if they don't take advantage of a great opportunity. They may think that if they don't get it, someone else will, and they won't have the same chance again. This fear can drive people to fight each other to get what they want.\n\nFinally, people may fight for a good deal because it is a form of competition. People like to show off their skills and prove themselves. If they can get a good deal, they feel like they are winning.\n\nRegardless of the reason, people fighting for a good deal can be a problem. It can create dangerous situations, and it can lead to people getting hurt. It is important for people to be aware of the risks and to stay calm when looking for a good deal. People should remember that fighting is not necessary and that there are other ways to get what they want."}
