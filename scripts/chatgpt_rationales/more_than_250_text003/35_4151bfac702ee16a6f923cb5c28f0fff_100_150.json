{"stem": "Given question: Where does litter end up when it's tossed from a car? and answer: roadsides, explain why in", "no_more_50_words": "If one was to toss garbage from a moving car, because the car is likely to be driving along a road, the trash would likely end up a few feet away on the road side.", "id": "4151bfac702ee16a6f923cb5c28f0fff", "more_than_250": "\n\nWhen litter is tossed from a car, it often ends up alongside the roads. This is because the litter is thrown out of the car window, or even deposited in a trash can on the side of the road, and is then blown around by the wind or scattered by animals. The litter is then left to accumulate and remain along the roadside.\n\nThe accumulation of litter along roadsides is a major issue, as it not only creates an eyesore, but it can also have serious negative impacts on the environment. Litter can be dangerous to animals, as they may try to eat it or become injured by sharp objects. It can also harm the soil, as plastic and other materials can leech toxins into the ground. In addition, the accumulation of litter along roadsides can lead to increased flooding, as the litter can block the flow of water and cause it to pool up and overflow.\n\nThe most effective way to prevent litter from ending up along roadsides is to ensure that it is disposed of properly. This means disposing of litter in a designated garbage or recycling bin, or even taking it home with you and disposing of it properly in a garbage or recycling container. Additionally, people can help to reduce litter by avoiding the use of single-use plastics, such as bags, straws, and bottles, as these often end up as roadside litter.\n\nUltimately, the best way to keep litter from ending up along roadsides is to ensure that it is properly disposed of. This can help to reduce the amount of litter that accumulates along the roadside and help to protect the environment."}
