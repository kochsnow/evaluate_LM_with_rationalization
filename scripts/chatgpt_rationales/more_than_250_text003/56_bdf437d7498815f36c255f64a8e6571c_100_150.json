This is because when one remembers a tragedy, it can be difficult to separate the emotions of the present moment from the emotions of the past. The feelings of grief and anguish experienced during the tragedy can come flooding back, leaving the person feeling overwhelmed and deeply sad.\n\nThe depression that can occur when remembering a tragedy can be due to a number of factors. For instance, when remembering a tragedy, people may be reminded of the loss they experienced, whether it be the loss of a loved one, their home, or their safety and security. This can be especially difficult if the tragedy was personal, as it can bring up a range of emotions related to the trauma, pain, and suffering they endured.\n\nIn addition, people may also feel depression when remembering a tragedy because of the feeling of helplessness that can arise. Knowing that there was nothing they could do to prevent the tragedy or to stop it from occurring can be difficult to cope with, and can leave people feeling a sense of hopelessness and despair.\n\nAnother reason why people may experience depression when remembering a tragedy is the fear that it could happen again. This fear can be especially intense when remembering a tragedy that was caused by a natural disaster, as the person may feel powerless against the forces of nature.\n\nFinally, people may feel depression when remembering a tragedy because of the guilt they may feel. They may feel guilt for not having done enough to prevent the tragedy or to lessen the pain and suffering of those affected.\n\nIn summary, when remembering a tragedy in the past, many people can feel a deep sense of depression. This is due to the feelings of loss, helplessness, fear, and guilt that can arise when remembering the tragedy, which can be difficult to cope with."}
