{"stem": "Given question: After being shipwrecked, Robinson relied on the huge tree to do what? and answer: provide shelter, explain why in", "no_more_50_words": "If one was stranded on a desert island after a boat crash, one of the things that you would probably seek out is shelter; things like trees and caves could provide cover from the rain.", "id": "56d28b341974d48dc6a052b1b3a8f31a", "more_than_250": "\n\nAfter being shipwrecked, Robinson relied on the huge tree to provide shelter. This is understandable given the circumstances. Being shipwrecked would have left Robinson in an unfamiliar and dangerous environment with few resources and no way to contact help. The tree was a Godsend in this situation as it gave Robinson a safe place to stay and rest.\n\nThe tree provided protection from the elements such as the sun, rain, and wind but also from any potential predators. This was very important because Robinson would have been unfamiliar with the local fauna and could have been in danger without the protection of the tree. It also provided a sense of security because Robinson was likely to be feeling anxious and alone in this new and dangerous environment.\n\nThe tree also provided Robinson with other resources such as food, clothing and tools. Depending on the type of tree, it could have provided him with fruits, nuts, and edible leaves. This would have been an invaluable source of sustenance, especially in the early days of the shipwreck when food was scarce. The tree could have also provided Robinson with wood for making tools and weapons, as well as material for clothing.\n\nOverall, the tree was a true lifesaver for Robinson. Not only did it provide protection from the elements and potential predators, but it also provided sustenance and resources for Robinson to survive. It was the perfect shelter for Robinson in his time of need, and it allowed him to remain safe until he was able to find a more permanent solution."}
