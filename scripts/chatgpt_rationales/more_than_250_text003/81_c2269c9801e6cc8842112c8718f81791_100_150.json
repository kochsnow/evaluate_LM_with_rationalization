{"stem": "Given question: That person next to me is always on her cell phone. and answer: talk about themselves, explain why in", "no_more_50_words": "When someone talks on the phone, they may discuss various topics with their conversation partner, e.g., themselves, and what's going on in their lives.", "id": "c2269c9801e6cc8842112c8718f81791", "more_than_250": "\n\nThat person next to me is always on her cell phone. It\u2019s clear that she\u2019s talking to her friends and family and that she\u2019s sharing stories, taking pictures, and doing whatever else people do on their phones these days.\n\nWhen I observe her, I can\u2019t help but notice that she\u2019s always talking about herself. She\u2019ll go on and on about her latest achievements, her successes, her trips, her favorite restaurants, and any other topic that revolves around her. It\u2019s like she\u2019s trying to make sure that everyone knows she\u2019s doing something noteworthy.\n\nI think it\u2019s normal for people to want to share their successes and accomplishments with their friends and family. It\u2019s a way for them to feel validated and appreciated. It\u2019s also a way of making sure that people know how great they\u2019re doing. It\u2019s a form of self-promotion, and it\u2019s a way of feeling connected to the people around them.\n\nAt the same time, it can become unhealthy if someone is constantly talking about themselves and not listening to what other people have to say. There\u2019s a fine line between being proud of your accomplishments and showing off too much. It\u2019s important to be conscious of your words and actions, and to make sure that you\u2019re not monopolizing the conversation.\n\nIt\u2019s also important to be mindful of the relationships that you\u2019re building with the people around you. Although it\u2019s natural to want to talk about yourself, it\u2019s important to remember that people have stories and experiences of their own. Make sure to take the time to listen to their stories and get to know them, as well.\n\nIn conclusion, it\u2019s normal for people to talk about themselves to some degree, but it\u2019s important to be aware of how much you\u2019re talking and how much you\u2019re listening. When it comes to relationships, it\u2019s important to strike a balance between talking and listening. Take the time to get to know the people around you and to truly understand their stories."}
