{"stem": "Given question: James had trouble learning the French language because he never had any what to it? and answer: exposure, explain why in", "no_more_50_words": "Inexperience with a language comes from lack of exposure to it, e.g., through a class or from living in a contry where the language is widely spoken. So, it might be difficult to learn French without being exposed to it (by studying, or living in a French-speaking country).", "id": "f191f283d891fc8a17459ff0d077ac55", "more_than_250": "\n\nExposure can play a vital role when it comes to learning a new language. When someone is exposed to a language, they are able to gain a better understanding of the language and its nuances. This is because exposure allows someone to hear the language being spoken, as well as be able to pick up on the different sounds, pronunciations, and intonations of the language. In addition, exposure to a language can help someone learn the grammar and syntax of the language more quickly. This is because they will be able to hear how the language is actually spoken and be able to pick up on the different nuances of the language.\n\nFurthermore, exposure to a language can also help someone learn the language more easily because they will be able to see how the language is written. Seeing how the language is written can help someone pick up on the different rules and structure of the language. For example, when someone is exposed to French, they will be able to see how the language is written, as well as which letters go together. This can help someone learn the language more quickly because they will be able to understand the structure of the language.\n\nExposure to a language can also help someone learn the language more quickly because it allows them to pick up on the culture of the language. Being exposed to the culture of a language can help someone better understand the language and its nuances. For example, when someone is exposed to French, they will be able to pick up on the different slang words and expressions that are used in the language. This can help someone better understand the language and pick up on the nuances that they may not have been able to pick up on if they did not have exposure to the language.\n\nIn conclusion, exposure to a language can play a vital role in helping someone learn the language. When someone has exposure to a language, they are able to pick up on the different sounds and intonations of the language, as well as the grammar and syntax. Furthermore, they will be able to pick up on the culture of the language, which can help them better understand the language. Therefore, in the case of James, if he had some exposure to the French language, he would have been able to learn the language more quickly."}
