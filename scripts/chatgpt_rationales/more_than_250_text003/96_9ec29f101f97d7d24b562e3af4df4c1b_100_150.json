Due to moving, members of the band must carry their instruments.", "id": "9ec29f101f97d7d24b562e3af4df4c1b", "more_than_250": "\n\nWhen someone carries their brass instrument while playing, they are usually playing in a marching band. A marching band consists of a group of instrumentalists who perform musical pieces while marching, usually in formation, at parades, football games, and other events.\n\nThe brass instruments are usually carried by the marching band members because they are the loudest instruments in the band. Brass instruments, such as trumpets, trombones, and tubas, create a powerful and resonant sound that can be heard above the other instruments and can be heard from far away. This makes them very important in a marching band as they are often used to lead the band and help keep them in rhythm while they march.\n\nCarrying brass instruments while playing also allows the musicians to move freely while playing. The instruments are usually hung around the necks of the musicians with straps and can be moved up and down while playing. This allows the musicians to play their instruments while marching and still be able to move and keep up with the marching band. \n\nCarrying brass instruments also allows for the musician to have more control over their sound. By moving the instrument up and down, the musician can create different tones, pitches, and volumes. This is especially useful in a marching band where the instruments need to be heard from a great distance.\n\nCarrying brass instruments while playing in a marching band is an important part of the performance. The instruments are usually carried in order to keep the band in rhythm and to be heard from a long distance. Additionally, it allows the musicians to have more control over their sound and to move freely while playing."}
