{"stem": "Given question: A John is a bum.  Much like the stereotype, he lives near this sort of transportation infrastructure. Where does he live? and answer: bridge, explain why in", "no_more_50_words": "bums are well known to take up residence under bridges.", "id": "3a1b3c21a11f4ec53c166b0559df7369", "more_than_250": "\n\nA John, or a male vagrant, is a person who lives outside the bounds of society, relying on scavenging and begging for food, clothing and shelter. Much like the stereotypes, a John typically lives in places that are relatively near places of transportation infrastructure, so he can easily access a larger population to beg from or places where he can find discarded items.\n\nOne of the most common places a John would live is near a bridge. Bridges provide a relatively safe shelter from the elements, as well as access to food, clothing, and other items that may have been discarded by passers-by. Furthermore, bridges are often located in urban areas, or near highways, which means that there is a larger population of people who may feel more inclined to provide aid or assistance to a John. Bridges also often provide access to other resources, such as public transportation. This allows a John to easily access different areas of the city to scavenge for items, or to beg from a larger population of people.\n\nBridges also provide a John with an easy means of escape if they are ever in danger. Since bridges are often elevated above the ground, they can provide a John with an opportunity to flee if they ever feel threatened. This can be especially useful in urban areas, where the risk of theft or other criminal activity is higher.\n\nFinally, bridges are often located near bodies of water, which can provide a John with access to food sources such as fish, as well as water for drinking and bathing. This can be particularly useful in areas where food and water are scarce.\n\nIn conclusion, a John is likely to find bridges to be an ideal place to live due to the easy access to resources and transportation infrastructure, as well as the safety and escape route it provides."}
