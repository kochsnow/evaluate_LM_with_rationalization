Washington is home to a diverse array of coastal ecosystems, including beaches. These beaches are home to a variety of plants and animals, including beavers.\n\nBeavers are aquatic mammals native to North America. They are known for their ability to build dams and lodges using sticks, mud, and stones. Beavers are also prolific loggers, cutting down trees and carrying them away to use in the construction of their lodges. This activity is known as \u201clogging.\u201d\n\nBeavers are particularly abundant in the Pacific Northwest, where they are found in large numbers in the coastal forests and along the beaches. Beavers are most active during the spring and summer months, when they are busy cutting and carrying logs. This is why it is not uncommon to see beavers carrying logs on a Pacific beach in Washington.\n\nBeavers are not only important to the environment, but they are also important to the local economy. Beavers control the growth of trees and shrubs, which helps maintain the health of the local forests. Beavers also help improve water quality by increasing the presence of water plants, which in turn helps keep the water clean.\n\nBeavers play an important role in the local ecology, so it is important to protect them and their habitats. Protecting beavers also helps protect the environment, as well as the local economy. Therefore, it is important to be aware of the activities of beavers and to take measures to protect them and their habitats in order to ensure that they continue to thrive."}
