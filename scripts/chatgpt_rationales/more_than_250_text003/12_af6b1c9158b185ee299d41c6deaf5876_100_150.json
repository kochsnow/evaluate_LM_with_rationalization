It was hunted for its meat, hide, and bones as well as its horns, which were made into tools and jewelry. Buffalo were an important source of food and clothing for the Native Americans, and their numbers began to decline drastically during the 19th century due to over-hunting and the destruction of their habitat.\n\nBy the late 1800s, the buffalo were nearly extinct. This was due to a combination of factors, including over-hunting, the destruction of their habitat, and diseases brought by settlers. The population of buffalo in the United States had decreased from an estimated 60 million in the early 1800s to only a few hundred by the late 1800s. This drastic decline in numbers was a major cause of concern for conservationists, and steps were taken to save the species from extinction.\n\nThe first step was to create national parks, such as Yellowstone National Park, which would provide a safe habitat for the buffalo. Additionally, hunting was strictly limited and regulated, and buffalo were protected by law. Various conservation efforts also focused on captive breeding, which allowed for the production of healthy buffalo populations.\n\nToday, thanks to these efforts, the buffalo are no longer endangered and are abundant in the United States. The population of buffalo is estimated to be between 500,000 and 1 million, with most of the animals living in protected areas such as national parks and wildlife reserves. Additionally, many of the buffalo found in the United States today are descendants of the original herds, which were saved from extinction.\n\nThe buffalo population has been steadily growing since the early 1900s, and while they are still considered a vulnerable species, they are no longer in danger of extinction. The success of the various conservation efforts has been instrumental in the recovery of this iconic species, and it is now considered one of the most abundant and successful wildlife species in North America."}
