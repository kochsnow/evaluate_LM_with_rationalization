Back gardens are often referred to as yards and are typically enclosed by a fence or wall. These outdoor spaces can be used for recreational activities such as gardening, outdoor dining, and entertaining, as well as providing additional privacy for homeowners. \n\nHaving a back garden can be a great way to enjoy the outdoors, get some fresh air, and relax in a private space. As back gardens are typically enclosed, they provide homeowners with a sense of security and privacy. This can be especially attractive to those living in urban areas who may not have access to a large open area. \n\nThe amount of space available in a back garden can vary depending on the size of the house, with larger homes usually having more space for a garden. A back garden can also be used for practical purposes such as growing fruits, vegetables, and herbs. This can be beneficial for those who have a green thumb or are looking for a sustainable way to produce their own food. \n\nBack gardens can also provide a great place for entertaining. Homeowners can host barbecues and dinners in the garden, or enjoy a leisurely afternoon in the sun. Outdoor lighting can be used to create a more inviting atmosphere and can be used to extend the hours of use. \n\nFor those looking to increase the value of their property, a back garden can be a great way to achieve this. Having a well-maintained and attractive garden can add aesthetic value to a property and make it more attractive to potential buyers. \n\nIn conclusion, a house is the only place that can have a back garden. Back gardens provide homeowners with a great way to enjoy the outdoors in a private and secure space. They can also be used for practical purposes such as growing food and can add value to a property."}
