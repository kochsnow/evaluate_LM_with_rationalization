Airplane travel can be a breeding ground for the spread of cold and flu viruses due to the close proximity of the passengers and limited air circulation. The air within a plane is recycled, and the humidity level is low, which can make it difficult to breathe and make people more susceptible to infection. A tissue holder may be necessary for a passenger who is already feeling the effects of a cold, such as a runny nose, as it is often difficult to find a place to store used tissues on an airplane.\n\nOn top of the potential health risks, airplane travel can be uncomfortable for someone who is already feeling under the weather. For example, the air pressure in an airplane cabin can cause pain in the head and ears, and the noise from the engines can be bothersome when a person is already feeling ill. Additionally, the confined space of an airplane can increase the risk of spreading germs, as the germs can spread quickly through the air when people are coughing and sneezing.\n\nIn order to reduce the risk of spreading germs and to make the airplane environment more comfortable for someone who is feeling ill, many airlines provide tissue holders in the seats of some of their aircraft. These tissue holders usually attach to the armrest of the seat, allowing the passenger to easily access a tissue when needed. In addition to providing tissue holders, many airlines are also taking additional measures to reduce the spread of germs in the air. For example, many airlines now provide hand sanitizer and masks for passengers to use, and some airlines are even installing air purifiers in the cabin to help reduce the spread of germs.\n\nOverall, it is possible that John is in an airplane if he asked for a tissue holder because he had a cold. Airplane travel can be a breeding ground for the spread of cold and flu viruses, and the confined space of an airplane can make it difficult to breathe and increase the risk of spreading germs. To reduce the risk of spreading germs and to make the environment more comfortable for passengers who are feeling ill, many airlines are now providing tissue holders and other amenities in the seats of some of their aircraft."}
