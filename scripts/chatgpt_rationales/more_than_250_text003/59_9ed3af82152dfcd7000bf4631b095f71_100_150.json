Running is a form of exercise that involves the use of large muscle groups, and when these muscles are used for a significant amount of time, they become fatigued and require rest in order to recover.\n\nWhen a person goes for a run, they are engaging in a form of aerobic exercise. This means that they are causing their heart rate to increase and their breathing rate to accelerate in order to increase the amount of oxygen that is brought to the muscles they are using. The muscles work harder than they normally would in order to keep up with the increased demand for oxygen, and this places a strain on them.\n\nThe increased heart rate and breathing rate also cause the body to produce lactic acid, which is a byproduct of intense exercise. This lactic acid builds up in the muscles, causing them to become sore and tired. As the person continues to run, their muscles become increasingly fatigued, leading to a feeling of tiredness.\n\nIn addition to the physical fatigue that comes from running, running can also cause mental fatigue. This is caused by the body\u2019s fight-or-flight response, which is triggered by the increased heart rate and breathing rate. This response causes the body to produce adrenaline and cortisol, two hormones that help to increase alertness and focus. However, these hormones can be taxing on the body and can cause mental fatigue when released in large amounts.\n\nOverall, going for a run can lead to physical fatigue due to the strain placed on the muscles, as well as mental fatigue caused by the hormones released during a run. Both of these factors can lead to an overall feeling of tiredness after a run."}
