{"stem": "Given question: James shaved, but this left a lot of hair where? and answer: sink, explain why in", "no_more_50_words": "People usually shave at the sink, and shaving leaves behind discarded hair.", "id": "eac3a4080127e8924034651b57dfa289", "more_than_250": "\n\nWhen James shaved, he likely did so in the bathroom sink. This is the most common place that people go to shave, as it provides easy access to water and a mirror. The sink also catches the hair and acts as a convenient place to rinse off the razor.\n\nWhen James finished shaving, he would have seen a lot of hair left behind in the sink. This is because shaving causes a lot of hair to be shed in a very short amount of time. Depending on how much hair James had, it could easily pile up in the sink. This is especially true if James was using a manual razor, as the hairs are cut much closer to the skin, resulting in more of the hair being released.\n\nThe hair left in the sink can be difficult to remove. It can be difficult to scoop it out with a spoon or cup, as it tends to stick to the sides of the sink. It can also be difficult to wipe away with a towel or cloth, as it will likely cling to them. The best way to remove the hair is to use a drain cleaner or a wet vacuum, as this will help to break up the hair and suck it away.\n\nIn addition to the hair in the sink, there is also likely to be some left on the counter. This is because when people shave, they often miss some of the hairs that are on the counter and they end up getting left behind. The best way to remove this hair is to use a damp cloth to wipe away the hair.\n\nOverall, when James shaved, he likely left behind a lot of hair in the sink. This is because shaving causes a lot of hair to be shed in a very short amount of time, which can easily build up in the sink. In addition to the hair in the sink, there is also likely to be some left on the counter, which can be removed with a damp cloth."}
