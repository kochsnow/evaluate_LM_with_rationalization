After all, what better place to meet interesting people than a bar?\n\nAt the bar, he encountered a wide variety of characters. There were the regulars, the people who seemed to be there every night, each with their own unique personality and story.

He had met interesting people, heard incredible stories, and gained a greater understanding of the world around him. Boredom had led him to the bar, but it was the conversations he had there that made it worth the trip."}
