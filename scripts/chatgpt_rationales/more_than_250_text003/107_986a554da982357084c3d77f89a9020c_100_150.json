This generally requires a subject in the form of a noun, and a verb.", "id": "986a554da982357084c3d77f89a9020c", "more_than_250": "\n\nA sentence is a string of words that contains a proper noun and verb. A sentence is the basic unit of language, conveying a complete thought, idea, or statement. A sentence must have at least one subject and one verb.\n\nA proper noun is a specific name for a person, place, or thing. Examples of proper nouns include names of people (like John Smith), names of places (like Paris, France), and names of things (like the Eiffel Tower). Proper nouns are always capitalized, no matter where they appear in a sentence.\n\nA verb is a word that expresses an action, state, or occurrence, or forms the main part of the predicate of a sentence. Verbs can be used to express physical or mental actions, such as \u201crun,\u201d \u201cwalk,\u201d \u201cthink,\u201d and \u201cbelieve.\u201d They can also be used to express states of being, such as \u201cam,\u201d \u201care,\u201d and \u201cwas.\u201d Verbs are essential to forming a complete sentence, as they show the action or state that is taking place.\n\nThe combination of a proper noun and verb forms a complete sentence. A sentence typically consists of two parts: a subject, which is the person, place, or thing performing the action, and a verb, which expresses the action being performed. For example, \u201cJohn ran.\u201d In this sentence, \u201cJohn\u201d is the proper noun, and \u201cran\u201d is the verb. Without both parts, the sentence is incomplete.\n\nSentences are the building blocks of communication. They are used to express ideas, thoughts, and opinions, and are the most basic form of written and spoken language. Sentences have the ability to convey meaning, and make a statement that can be understood by others. By combining a proper noun and verb, a sentence can be formed that is both clear and complete."}
