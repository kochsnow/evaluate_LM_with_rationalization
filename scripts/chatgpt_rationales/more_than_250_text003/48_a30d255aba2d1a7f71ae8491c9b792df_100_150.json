The chain is an essential component of the motorbike's transmission system, as it is responsible for transferring power from the motor to the rear wheel. The chain is connected to the motor and runs along the side of the frame to the back wheel. It is made of a series of connected metal rings, which are held together by a roller.\n\nThe chain is a very reliable form of power transmission, as it is resistant to wear and tear, and is largely unaffected by dirt and dust. The chain is also very durable, as it is made of a heavy-duty steel that can withstand the force generated by the motor. The chain is also relatively easy to maintain, as it only requires occasional lubrication to ensure it runs smoothly.\n\nThe chain is able to move the back wheel by transferring the power generated by the motor to the back wheel. As the motor rotates, the chain rotates along with it. This rotation of the chain causes the back wheel to rotate as well, allowing the motorbike to move forward. The chain is responsible for transferring the power generated by the motor to the back wheel, as well as providing the necessary traction to keep the motorbike moving.\n\nThe chain is also an important component of the motorbike's safety system. The chain is able to provide additional traction when the motorbike is stopped, as it is connected to the rear wheel. This ensures that the motorbike remains stable when it is stopped, and prevents it from slipping or skidding. Additionally, the chain is able to absorb the force of the motor, which helps to reduce the risk of injury in the event of an accident.\n\nIn conclusion, a motorbike uses a chain to move the back wheel. The chain is an essential component of the motorbike's transmission system, as it is responsible for transferring power from the motor to the rear wheel. The chain is also able to provide additional traction when the motorbike is stopped, as well as absorbing the force of the motor, making it an important component of the motorbike's safety system."}
