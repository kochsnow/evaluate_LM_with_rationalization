One main factor is the drop in temperature; when the temperature around us drops, our bodies are naturally affected, and we feel the chill in the air. This is because the body is trying to maintain its internal temperature, and so it draws heat from the environment to compensate. This is why it is important to dress appropriately when outside in the winter, as extra layers can help to keep you warm.\n\nAnother factor that contributes to why people feel cold in the winter is the lack of sunlight. During the winter months, the days are much shorter and there is less sunlight. As a result, our bodies are not exposed to as much sunlight and do not get the warmth and energy that it provides. This lack of sunlight can also disrupt our circadian rhythms, our body\u2019s \u201cinternal clock\u201d, which can affect our metabolism and make us feel more sluggish and cold.\n\nIn addition, people feel colder in the winter because of the wind chill. This is because when the wind blows, it takes away the warm air already around us and replaces it with cold air. This cold air is then blown onto our skin and can make us feel even colder.\n\nFinally, people feel colder in the winter because of the humidity. The air in the winter is typically much drier than in other seasons, and this dry air is not as good at trapping heat as the humid air of the summer months. This results in the air feeling colder and us feeling colder too.\n\nOverall, there are a number of factors that contribute to why people feel cold in the winter. These include the decrease in temperature, the lack of sunlight, the wind chill, and the decrease in humidity. All of these factors together can make the winter months a very cold time of year."}
