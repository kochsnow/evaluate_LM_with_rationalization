This would ensure that the burial grounds were respected and maintained in a proper manner, and that the graveyard served its purpose as a place of remembrance and mourning for those who had passed away.\n\nThe graveyard would usually be located on the church property in order to be closer to the house of worship. This would also be a way to honor and remember the deceased, as they would be laid to rest in the same place that they had worshipped during their lifetime. Furthermore, the graveyard would provide a place for the family to visit and grieve together when necessary.\n\nFurthermore, by having the graveyard located on the church property, it would be easier to maintain. The church would be responsible for keeping the graveyard clean and well-maintained, as it would be considered the property of the church. This would also ensure that the graveyard was a safe place for visitors, as the church would be able to ensure that the grounds were properly maintained in order to ensure the safety of those visiting the area.\n\nThe graveyard would also have to be zoned in order to adhere to local laws and regulations. This would be important in order to ensure that the graveyard was in an appropriate location and that it was not infringing upon the rights of any other property owners. The zoning would also ensure that the graveyard was in an area where it would not be a nuisance to the surrounding area, as it would have to be large enough to accommodate the number of burials that would be taking place.\n\nThe pastor would be responsible for ensuring that the graveyard was properly zoned, as it was located on the church property. This would ensure that the graveyard was kept in a respectful and proper manner, and that it served as a proper location for mourning and remembrance."}
