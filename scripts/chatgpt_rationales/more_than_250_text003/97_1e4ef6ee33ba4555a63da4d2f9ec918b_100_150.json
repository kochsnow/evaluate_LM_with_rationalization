{"stem": "Given question: The calm seas weren't going to stay that way long, their sails filled as it got what? and answer: windy, explain why in", "no_more_50_words": "Wind often makes a sea choppy, the opposite of calm. Sails fill with wind. ", "id": "1e4ef6ee33ba4555a63da4d2f9ec918b", "more_than_250": "\n\nThe phrase \u201cThe calm seas weren't going to stay that way long, their sails filled as it got windy\u201d suggests that the calm seas were going to become more turbulent due to windy conditions. This is because wind is an important factor in sailing, and it is required to move a sailboat forward. The wind fills the sails of the boat, providing it with the power to move through the water.\n\nWind is caused by air pressure differences that occur when air is heated and rises up. This creates an area of low pressure, which in turn causes air from areas of high pressure to rush in, creating wind. The higher the temperature and humidity, the stronger the wind can be. This can be seen on days when the weather is particularly hot and humid.\n\nWhen the wind is blowing, it allows the sails of a sailboat to fill with air, providing the boat with the power to move forward. This is why a calm sea can quickly become turbulent when the wind picks up. The wind fills the sails of the boat, which causes the boat to move and the sea to become choppier.\n\nIn addition to providing power to a sailboat, wind can also cause a number of other issues. Strong winds can cause waves and make it difficult to steer the boat. In addition, they can cause the boat to heel over, which is when the boat is tipped to one side. This can be dangerous and can cause the boat to capsize if it is not managed properly.\n\nTherefore, it is clear why the phrase \u201cThe calm seas weren't going to stay that way long, their sails filled as it got windy\u201d is true. The wind is necessary for a sailboat to move forward, but it can also cause a number of issues if it is too strong. As such, it is important for sailors to be aware of the wind conditions and to take precautions when necessary."}
