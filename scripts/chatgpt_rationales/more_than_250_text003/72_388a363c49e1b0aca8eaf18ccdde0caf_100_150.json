{"stem": "Given question: Where can someone view a county highway as a line? and answer: map, explain why in", "no_more_50_words": "The only context in which an entire county road could be represented meaningfully as a single line would be on a map, e.g., a map of roads in the county, or a GPS application on a smartphone.", "id": "388a363c49e1b0aca8eaf18ccdde0caf", "more_than_250": "\n\nOne of the most effective ways to view a county highway as a line is by using a map. A map is a representation of the physical landscape, showing the major roads, highways, and other features such as rivers and cities. Maps can be used to plan a route, to show an area in detail, or to display a larger area with an overview.\n\nUsing a map to view a county highway as a line is beneficial because it allows the user to easily identify the highway, as well as any other important features in the area. Additionally, a map can be used to determine the best route to take and to plan out a trip. The user can zoom in or out on the map to get a better view of the area, or to see a larger view of the landscape.\n\nAnother advantage of using a map to view a county highway as a line is that it can help in determining the length of the highway. By measuring the distance between two points on the map, the user can accurately estimate the length of the highway. This can be especially useful when planning a trip as the user can determine how long it will take to get to their destination.\n\nMaps can also provide other important information about the area such as the elevation of the highway and the potential for traffic congestion. By looking at the map, the user can determine how steep the highway is, how much traffic it is likely to experience, and potential areas of congestion. This information can be used to plan the most efficient route and to avoid any potential delays.\n\nOverall, maps are an effective way to view a county highway as a line. They provide the user with detailed information about the area, can be used to plan the most efficient route, and can also provide additional information about the area such as the elevation and potential traffic congestion."}
