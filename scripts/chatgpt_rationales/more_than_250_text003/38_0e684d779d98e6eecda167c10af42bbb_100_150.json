Because the USA boarders Canada, a highway could exist that connect them. ", "id": "0e684d779d98e6eecda167c10af42bbb", "more_than_250": "\n\nAn expressway, also known as a freeway or motorway, is a limited access road designed for high-speed travel and long distances. Expressways are often used to connect major cities and towns, and some may even extend beyond a country\u2019s borders. Many expressways leave the United States to go to Canada, as the two countries share a long land border.\n\nThe two countries have a long history of trade and commerce, so it\u2019s natural that a road system would be developed to facilitate movement between the two nations. For many years, the only way to cross the border was by car or train, but in recent decades expressways have been built to make it easier and faster for people to travel between the two countries.\n\nThe most famous of these expressways is the Trans-Canada Highway, which stretches from the Atlantic to the Pacific coast. This major road connects cities and towns in both Canada and the United States, and provides easy access to the major cities of both countries. The highway is well maintained and is a popular route for tourists and business travelers alike.\n\nIn addition to the Trans-Canada Highway, there are several other expressways that cross the border. In the northwest, the Cascades Highway connects Seattle, Washington to Vancouver, British Columbia. In the northeast, the Interstate 87 links Montreal, Quebec with New York City. In the Midwest, the I-94 links Detroit, Michigan with Windsor, Ontario.\n\nIn addition to providing a convenient crossing point between the two countries, expressways are also important for economic development. They make it easier for businesses to move goods and services between the two countries, and they provide a much-needed boost to infrastructure and transportation.\n\nIn conclusion, expressways leave the United States to go to Canada because the two countries share a long land border and have a long history of trade and commerce. Expressways provide an easy and efficient way to cross the border and are important for the economic development of both countries."}
