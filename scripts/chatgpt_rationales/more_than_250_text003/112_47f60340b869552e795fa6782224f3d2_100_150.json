This can be caused by snow becoming heavy, because gravity will pull the snow downward.", "id": "47f60340b869552e795fa6782224f3d2", "more_than_250": "\n\nWhen snow on a mountain becomes heavy, avalanches can occur. Avalanches are a natural phenomenon that occurs when a large amount of snow or ice breaks away from the side of the mountain and slides down. The snow and ice can be tightly packed together and can reach speeds of up to 300 miles per hour.\n\nAvalanches can be triggered by many different factors, but the most common is when the snow on a mountain becomes too heavy. When the weight of the snow increases, the snow becomes denser and compacts. This compaction causes the snow to become less stable, and as the weight continues to increase, the snow can become overloaded and break away from the mountain. Once the snow breaks away, it slides down the mountain, taking anything in its path with it.\n\nIn addition to the weight of the snow, avalanches can also be triggered by other factors. These include sudden changes in temperature, vibrations from nearby vehicles, or an increase in wind speed. All of these factors can cause the snow to become unstable and break away from the mountain.\n\nAvalanches are dangerous and can cause serious injury or death. The best way to prevent an avalanche is to be aware of the conditions on the mountain. People should avoid areas of the mountain that have dense snow or snowdrifts, and they should be aware of any weather changes that could cause the snow to become unstable. Additionally, people should always be aware of their surroundings and be aware of any signs that an avalanche could be imminent.\n\nAvalanches can be a dangerous force of nature, but with the right knowledge and preparation, people can stay safe and enjoy the beauty of the mountain."}
