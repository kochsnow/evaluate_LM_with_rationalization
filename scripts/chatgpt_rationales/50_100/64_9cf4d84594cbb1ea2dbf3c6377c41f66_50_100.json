Their bodies are adapted to the specific conditions of the ocean, such as the right salinity levels, temperature and oxygen levels. These sharks can not survive long in fresh water lake, as lake water has low salinity which would impact the osmoregulation of shark's body, also lake water might have different temperature and oxygen level compare to shark's natural habitat which could harm the shark. In addition, freshwater lakes typically do not have the same variety and abundance of prey that sharks are adapted to hunt, which would make it difficult for the shark to find food.\n\n"}
