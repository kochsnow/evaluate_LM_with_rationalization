John might need a tissue from the tissue holder to blow his nose for his cold to prevent transmitting germs.", "id": "388dada77986465f8e46410bd8a89d0e", "50_to_100_words": "It is likely that John is on an airplane because he asked for a tissue holder. Airplanes are often equipped with tissue holders in the seat back pockets or on the tray tables for passengers to use during the flight. Cold and flu viruses can spread easily in closed, poorly ventilated spaces like airplanes, so it is not uncommon for passengers to get colds while traveling by air. Having a tissue holder readily available can help prevent the spread of germs by providing a convenient way to catch sneezes and wipe away runny noses.\n\n"}
