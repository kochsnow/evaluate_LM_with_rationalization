Additionally, school libraries typically have a focus on educational materials and resources that are tailored to the age group and curriculum of the students that attend the school. They often have wide range of collections and resources, such as textbooks, reference materials, and digital resources that support the curriculum and research needs of the students and faculty.\n\n"}
