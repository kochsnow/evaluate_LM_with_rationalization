Shoes act as a barrier between the feet and the ground, providing a layer of protection from sharp objects, rough surfaces, and extreme temperatures. Socks, on the other hand, help to wick away moisture and keep the feet dry, which can prevent blisters and fungal infections. Together, shoes and socks also help to improve foot hygiene by keeping the feet clean and reducing the amount of bacteria and fungus that can grow on the skin. Additionally, shoes and socks also support the feet and improve the overall physical comfort while standing, walking or running.\n\n"}
