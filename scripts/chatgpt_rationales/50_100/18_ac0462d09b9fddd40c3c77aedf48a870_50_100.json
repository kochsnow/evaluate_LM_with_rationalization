{"stem": "Given question: John runs a small corner shop.   If you were walking on a sidewalk near it, where would you look for it? and answer: street corner, explain why in", "no_more_50_words": "Corner shops often are run out of buildings on street corners.", "id": "ac0462d09b9fddd40c3c77aedf48a870", "50_to_100_words": "A small corner shop, like the one John runs, is typically located at the intersection of two streets, hence the name \"corner shop.\" The intersection is also referred to as a street corner. This is because a corner shop is often a small, independently-owned business that makes use of a small amount of available space in a convenient location that is easily accessible to both pedestrians and motorists. The store would be visible when you are walking on a sidewalk near it. The visibility of the store will depend on how the area is designed (e.g. how tall the building are around) but generally speaking a small shop will be easy to spot on street corner.\n\n"}
