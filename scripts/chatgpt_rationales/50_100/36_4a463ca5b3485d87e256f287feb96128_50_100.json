It is not optional, meaning that it cannot be chosen not to be done. The reason why it is obligatory is because it is imposed by some external force or authority, such as a law, rule, or social norm. For example, paying taxes is obligatory because it is required by law. Failure to do so can result in legal consequences. Or another example would be like going to school is obligatory until a certain age, because it is required by the state education system. Failure to attend school can result in penalties for the parents or guardians of the student.\n\n"}
