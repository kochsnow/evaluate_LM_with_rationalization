First, residential areas are often where cats are kept as pets, so it is more likely for cats to be present there. Additionally, residential areas typically have more food sources for cats, such as gardens, bird feeders, and garbage cans, which can attract cats to the area. Finally, residential areas are often less crowded and quieter than other areas, such as commercial or industrial areas, which can provide a safer environment for cats to wander in.\n\n"}
