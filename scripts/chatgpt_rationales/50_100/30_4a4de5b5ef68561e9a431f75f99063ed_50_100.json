{"stem": "Given question: John put something on the night table.  But he forgot about it in the morning because it was unfamiliar. Where was he? and answer: hotel, explain why in", "no_more_50_words": "Hotels are places where people sleep for a few nights when they are travelling, and so it's often the case that hotel guests would be unfamiliar with their room. Given that travellers are unfamiliar with the location, losing items, for example in a night stand, might be more common.", "id": "4a4de5b5ef68561e9a431f75f99063ed", "50_to_100_words": "It is likely that John was in a hotel because the context of \"night table\" implies that he was staying in a temporary lodging with amenities such as a bedside table. Additionally, the fact that the object he placed on the table was unfamiliar suggests that it may have been a personal item brought with him on a trip, rather than something that would be found in a permanent residence. Furthermore, the fact that he forgot about it in the morning because it was unfamiliar also supports that he may have been in a hotel where he stayed for a short time.\n\n"}
