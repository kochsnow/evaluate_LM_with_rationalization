Pain receptors, called nociceptors, are located throughout the body and are activated by a variety of stimuli, such as pressure, temperature changes, and tissue damage. When activated, these receptors send a signal through the nervous system to the brain, where the sensation of pain is perceived. The sensation of pain serves as a warning that prompts the animal to take action to protect the injured area, such as withdrawing from the source of the pain or seeking medical attention. Additionally, pain also activates the body's natural healing mechanisms and triggers the release of hormones that can help to reduce inflammation and promote tissue repair.\n\n"}
