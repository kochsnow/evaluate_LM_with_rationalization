This is because a tree can provide an overhead covering from the sun, rain and other elements. Additionally, the branches and foliage of the tree can also provide additional protection from the elements and can help to block wind. A tree also provides a source of materials that can be used to build a shelter, such as branches and leaves. In Robinson's case, the use of a tree to provide shelter is logical given the lack of other resources and structure available on the island.\n\n"}
