Jars are typically airtight, which means that they are sealed tightly so that liquid or air cannot escape or enter. This will help to keep the olives fresh and prevent any liquid from the olives from escaping and getting on other nearby food. Additionally, jars are often made of glass or other non-porous materials, which can also help to contain any liquids and prevent them from spreading.\n\n"}
