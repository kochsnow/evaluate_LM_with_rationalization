The forklift can be used to lift heavy boxes and place them on high shelves, which can be difficult to reach by hand. The forklift also allows for safe and efficient stacking of boxes, as it can be precisely positioned and controlled to avoid damage to the boxes or surrounding area. Additionally, using a forklift to stack boxes onto shelves can save time and labor, as one operator can easily move and stack multiple boxes at once, rather than manually carrying and stacking each box individually.\n\n"}
