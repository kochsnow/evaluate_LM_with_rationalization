A pastor manages his church's property. If he is zoning the graveyard, it must be on his church's property. ", "id": "ebf347934a3e90ea46d3d87726fb5d25", "50_to_100_words": "The graveyard being \"zoned by the pastor\" suggests that it was located on church property. This is likely because graveyards are typically associated with places of worship, such as churches, and the pastor would have authority over the property and its use. Additionally, it is common for churches to have graveyards on their grounds as a way to provide a final resting place for members of their congregation. This is also fitting for the pastoral role of comforting and helping the bereaved and having them have the final resting place of their loved one near the church to ease the grieving process.\n\n"}
