The reason for this is that mail services offer both delivery and shipping services, so in addition to delivering packages to recipients, they also allow individuals and businesses to ship packages to other locations. The service provider will go to sender address for pick up the package and then deliver it to the intended recipient. This enables customers to easily send packages and mail to other people and businesses without having to go to a post office or shipping facility themselves.\n\n"}
