Thus, well water ultimately comes from the grond.", "id": "28ca5cbe27774746c34f6ebe84fc6d0c", "50_to_100_words": "Well water is water that is obtained from a hole drilled into the ground. This hole, called a well, is typically dug into an underground water source, such as an aquifer. Water is drawn from the well to the surface using a pump. The water found in a well can come from precipitation that has infiltrated the ground and been stored in an aquifer, or it can be from a subterranean river or stream. Depending on the location and geology, wells can tap into different types of aquifers such as: sand and gravel, fractures or porous rock, or a confined aquifers. The depth of the well, and the location and size of the aquifer will determine the yield of the well.\n\n"}
