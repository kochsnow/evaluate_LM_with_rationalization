However, due to overhunting, their numbers dwindled and they were nearly extinct by the late 1800s. This was largely due to the large-scale commercial hunting of buffalo for their hides, which were used to make leather goods. Additionally, the expansion of the railroads through the American West also played a role in their decline, as buffalo were killed as an obstacle to progress.\n\nFortunately, conservation efforts have driven a dramatic recovery of the species. In the early 1900s, a few individuals and organizations worked to protect remaining herds, and by the mid-1900s, several public and private lands were set aside to create buffalo sanctuaries. Additionally, some ranchers began raising buffalo on private ranches, providing a sustainable source of income while protecting the species.\n\nThe result of these efforts has been an incredible comeback for the species, with the population now estimated to be over 500,000.
