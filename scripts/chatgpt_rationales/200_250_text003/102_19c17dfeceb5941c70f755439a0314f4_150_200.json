Airplanes usually travel in the sky because of the natural lift that the air provides to help the plane stay in the air. Flying in the sky is also the safest form of travel because there are no obstacles, such as buildings or mountains, to impede the plane's path. The air in the sky is also less dense than the air on the ground, so the plane can travel faster and more efficiently in the sky. Furthermore, the air in the sky is often more stable than the air on the ground, meaning that the plane won't experience as much turbulence. Finally, the sky is the only place where airplanes can fly without having to worry about traffic, which can be a major issue on the ground.\n\nIn conclusion, airplanes usually go in the sky because it is the safest and most efficient form of travel. The sky provides natural lift to the plane, and the air is less dense and more stable than the air on the ground. Furthermore, flying in the sky eliminates the risk of traffic, which can be a major issue on the ground. All of these factors make the sky the ideal destination for airplanes."}
