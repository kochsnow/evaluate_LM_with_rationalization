In today\u2019s world, it can be difficult to find a good deal, and when someone does, they want to make sure that it's theirs. If they don't act quickly, they may miss out on the opportunity, so they become desperate and willing to fight for it. \n\nThis is especially common in stores that offer limited quantities of a product at a discounted price. The competition for these items is intense, and people become competitive and pushy, trying to get the item before anyone else does. This often leads to heated arguments and physical fights.\n\nIt\u2019s important to remember that while people are trying to get a good deal, they still need to respect each other's boundaries and treat each other with courtesy. Fighting over a good deal is not an acceptable behavior, and it can have serious consequences. It\u2019s important to remember to stay calm and try to find a peaceful solution to the problem."}
