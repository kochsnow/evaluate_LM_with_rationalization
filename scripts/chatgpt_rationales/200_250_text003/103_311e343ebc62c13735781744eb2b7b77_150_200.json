Packaged corn is pre-prepared by grocery store employees, so it is generally more expensive.", "id": "311e343ebc62c13735781744eb2b7b77", "150_to_200_words": ".\n\nThe reason Sam and June bought loose corn instead of packaged corn is because it was less expensive. Loose corn is generally sold in bulk, meaning that more corn is being sold at once. This creates a lower price per unit, as the store is able to purchase and sell more at once. Additionally, loose corn is usually not as processed as packaged corn, and therefore not as costly to produce. This helps to keep the cost of loose corn lower than packaged corn. \n\nAnother factor that helps to keep the cost of loose corn lower is that there is no packaging involved. Packaged corn requires more materials and labor, which then gets added onto the price of the product. This makes the cost of packaged corn higher than loose corn.\n\nLoose corn also has a longer shelf-life than packaged corn. This is due to the lack of packaging, which can protect the product from damage, but can also create an environment that is not ideal for long-term storage. Since loose corn does not need to be packaged, it can be stored for much longer than packaged corn. This makes it a more cost-effective option for those who need to buy in bulk.\n\nOverall, loose corn is a more cost-effective option than packaged corn"}
