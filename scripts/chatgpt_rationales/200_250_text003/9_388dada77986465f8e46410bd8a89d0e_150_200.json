Airplanes are well known for having poor air quality, which can cause passengers to become ill. The air in an airplane is recycled and is not filtered, so it is more likely to contain allergens, viruses, and bacteria. Additionally, the air pressure in an airplane is lower than the air pressure on the ground, which can cause dehydration. Dehydration can lead to colds and other illnesses. \n\nIn order to help prevent the spread of illness, airlines provide tissue holders and other items, such as hand sanitizer, in the seat pockets.
