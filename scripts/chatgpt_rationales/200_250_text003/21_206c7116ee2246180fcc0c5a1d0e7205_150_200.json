It is usually a liquid with a strong flavor and smell, such as mint, cinnamon, or tea tree oil. While it is possible to buy mouthwash in many stores, it is most likely to be found in a little paper cup at the dentist's office.\n\nWhen you visit the dentist, they will often give you a small paper cup filled with mouthwash to use before or after your appointment. This is done for a few reasons. First, the dentist wants you to have a clean mouth to ensure that any dental work is done correctly and that no germs or bacteria are transferred from your mouth to the instruments used during your appointment. Second, it is a way for the dentist to check for any signs of gum disease or other oral health problems. Finally, it helps to freshen your breath, which is a nice bonus after a visit to the dentist.\n\nThe mouthwash provided in a paper cup at the dentist's office is usually a higher concentration than what can be bought in stores. This is because the dentist wants to make sure that the mouthwash is strong enough to kill any germs or bacteria that may be in your mouth."}
