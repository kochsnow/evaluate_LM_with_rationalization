Rain clouds are formed when warm air rises and cools, condensing into droplets of water. As the droplets of water accumulate, they become too heavy for the air to hold and fall as rain. This process is known as the water cycle. \n\nThe water cycle begins when the sun heats the Earth's surface, causing water to evaporate and turn into water vapor. As the water vapor rises, it cools and condenses into clouds. In the clouds, the water vapor forms tiny droplets of water which, when they get too heavy, fall back to Earth as rain. The water that falls back to the Earth helps to fill rivers, lakes, and oceans. \n\nThe water cycle is an important part of the environment. It helps to keep the Earth's temperature stable and maintains the balance of water on the planet. Without the water cycle, the Earth would be a very different place. Without it, there would be no rain to water crops and replenish the Earth's freshwater supply. Without rain, the Earth would become a dry and barren place. \n\nThe water cycle is a continuous cycle that helps to maintain the balance of water on the planet. It is a"}
