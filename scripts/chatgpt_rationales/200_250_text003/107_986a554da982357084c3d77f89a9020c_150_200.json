A sentence is composed of two or more words that are connected in a logical and meaningful way. A sentence typically starts with a capital letter and ends with a punctuation mark, such as a period, question mark, or exclamation point.\n\nA proper noun is the name given to a specific person, place, thing, or idea. It is always capitalized and can be a single word, such as 'John', or a combination of two or more words, such as 'New York'. A verb is an action word that describes what is happening in a sentence.
