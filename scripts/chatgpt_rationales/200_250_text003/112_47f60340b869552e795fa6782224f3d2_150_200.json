This can be caused by snow becoming heavy, because gravity will pull the snow downward.", "id": "47f60340b869552e795fa6782224f3d2", "150_to_200_words": "\n\nWhen snow accumulates on a mountain, it becomes heavy and is no longer able to remain in place. When this occurs, it can cause an avalanche. An avalanche is a large mass of snow, ice, and rocks that rush down the side of a mountain or hill. This is caused by a build-up of snow, including fresh snowfall, which can become unstable and slide down the mountain in a sudden movement.\n\nThe instability of the snow is caused by several factors. First, the weight of the snow can become too great for the mountain to support, and the snow can no longer remain in place. Second, the shape of the mountain can create a situation where the snow is unable to settle and is instead pushed down the mountain. Third, warm temperatures can cause the snow to melt and become too heavy to remain in place. Lastly, when snow is packed too tightly, it can become unstable and cause an avalanche.\n\nAvalanches can be extremely dangerous and cause serious damage to both people and property. They can occur in any season and can be triggered by a variety of factors, including snowfall, warm temperatures, and the shape of the mountain. Avalanches can also be triggered by human activity, such as skiing, snowboarding,"}
