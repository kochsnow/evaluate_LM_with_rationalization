Motorbikes are a popular form of transportation, as they are relatively inexpensive and highly maneuverable. The chain is used to transfer the power from the motor to the back wheel, allowing the motorbike to move forward.\n\nThe chain is connected to the back wheel and is driven by a sprocket that is connected to the motor. When the motor is running, the sprocket will turn, causing the chain to move. This motion is transferred to the back wheel and propels the motorbike forward. The chain is able to maintain a steady speed, making it ideal for traveling distances.\n\nThe chain is also able to transfer power to the back wheel even when the motor is not running. This is done by pedaling the motorbike, which will cause the sprocket to turn and power the back wheel. This is a great way to save fuel, as the motor does not need to be running to move the bike.\n\nThe chain is also a much more efficient way of transferring power than gears. Gears require multiple components to work, meaning that they are more prone to failure. Chains, on the other hand, are much simpler and require less maintenance"}
