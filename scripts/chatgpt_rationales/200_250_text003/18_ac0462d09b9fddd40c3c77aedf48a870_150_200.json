{"stem": "Given question: John runs a small corner shop.   If you were walking on a sidewalk near it, where would you look for it? and answer: street corner, explain why in", "no_more_50_words": "Corner shops often are run out of buildings on street corners.", "id": "ac0462d09b9fddd40c3c77aedf48a870", "150_to_200_words": "\n\nIf you were walking on a sidewalk near a small corner shop owned by John, the first place to look for it would be at a street corner. This is because small corner shops are often located at street corners, due to the convenience of being at the intersection of two roads. This way, the shop can be easily accessed from both roads, and customers have a better chance of seeing the shop and stopping in to buy something.\n\nFurthermore, having a shop at a street corner helps to maximize the amount of foot traffic that the shop receives. Pedestrians walking along the sidewalk will be able to see the shop from a distance and may be more likely to stop in as a result. People driving by in cars will also be able to see the shop from a distance, as the shop is more visible at a street corner than it would be if it were located further down the sidewalk.\n\nIn addition, if the shop is located at a street corner, John may be able to obtain permission from the local government to set up a small outdoor stand in front of his shop. This will allow him to display and sell items such as produce or snacks that wouldn\u2019t fit inside the shop, and it may help to attract more customers.\n\nOverall"}
