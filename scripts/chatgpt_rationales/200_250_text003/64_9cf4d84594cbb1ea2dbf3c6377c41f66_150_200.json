Sharks' bodies are built to maintain a constant level of salt in their cells despite changes in the salinity of their environment. This is known as osmosis, which is when a liquid passes through a semipermeable membrane to reach equilibrium. Saltwater has a higher concentration of salt than freshwater, so when a shark is in freshwater, the water will pass through the semipermeable membrane of its cells to try to reach equilibrium. This causes the cells to lose salt and become dehydrated, leading to the shark's death.\n\nSharks are also adapted to saltwater because their gills are designed to extract oxygen from the water. Sharks need to extract more oxygen from saltwater than from freshwater, so when they are in freshwater, they do not get enough oxygen to survive. Freshwater also contains more dissolved solids than saltwater, which can clog the gills and cause decreased oxygen absorption.\n\nFinally, sharks are adapted to live in saltwater because they need to migrate in order to breed and feed. Sharks must migrate from the warmer equatorial waters to the colder polar regions in order to breed. They also must migrate to the coastal regions in"}
