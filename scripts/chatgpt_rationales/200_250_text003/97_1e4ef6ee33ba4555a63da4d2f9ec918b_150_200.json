Wind plays a role in the formation of waves, which can cause the seas to become choppy and dangerous. Wind also affects the speed and direction of ships, so the sailors had to take advantage of the wind when it was present. With the wind, their sails filled up and propelled the ships forward.\n\nWind is created by pressure differences in the atmosphere, and it generally flows from areas of high pressure to areas of low pressure. High pressure systems are generally associated with clear skies and generally light winds, while low pressure systems are often associated with clouds and strong winds. When the sailors noticed that the skies were clear and the pressure was high, they knew that the winds were going to pick up soon.\n\nWinds can also cause storms to form, which can be incredibly dangerous for sailors out on the open ocean. Storms are created when warm and cold air masses meet and the warm air rises, creating an area of low pressure. As the warm air rises, it is replaced by cold air, which then creates an area of high pressure. This creates a pressure gradient, which causes the wind to pick up and the seas to"}
