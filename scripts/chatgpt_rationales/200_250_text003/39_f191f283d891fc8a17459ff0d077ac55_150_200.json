{"stem": "Given question: James had trouble learning the French language because he never had any what to it? and answer: exposure, explain why in", "no_more_50_words": "Inexperience with a language comes from lack of exposure to it, e.g., through a class or from living in a contry where the language is widely spoken. So, it might be difficult to learn French without being exposed to it (by studying, or living in a French-speaking country).", "id": "f191f283d891fc8a17459ff0d077ac55", "150_to_200_words": "\n\nExposure is the key to learning any language; without it, one cannot gain the necessary knowledge to become proficient in the language. In James\u2019s case, he never had any exposure to the French language, meaning he never had the opportunity to hear it spoken, to have conversations in it, or to read books written in it. Without this exposure, it\u2019s hard for him to learn the language.\n\nA lack of exposure to French can also hamper James\u2019s ability to develop an understanding of the language\u2019s grammar and syntax. Without regular exposure to the language, it\u2019s difficult to understand how the words, phrases, and sentences are structured, and how they\u2019re used in everyday conversation. Furthermore, without exposure to the language, James can\u2019t develop an ear for it or learn how to pronounce words and phrases correctly.\n\nAnother problem is that James may be lacking the motivation to learn the language. Without having any exposure to it, it can be hard for James to understand why it\u2019s important for him to learn French. Without this motivation, it\u2019s unlikely that James will take the initiative to learn the language on his own.\n\nIn conclusion, without any exposure"}
