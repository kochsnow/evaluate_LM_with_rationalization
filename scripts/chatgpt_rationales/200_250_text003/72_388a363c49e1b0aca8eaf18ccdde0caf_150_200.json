Maps provide a bird's eye view of an area, allowing a person to see the shape of the land and the roads that traverse it. County highways are generally composed of two-lane roads, so a map will show the highways as clearly defined lines that run from one point to another. Maps also provide useful information about the surrounding area, such as nearby cities, towns, and attractions. For example, a map of a county highway may show rest stops, gas stations, and other facilities that are located along the route. This information can be very helpful when planning a road trip or when trying to find a specific location. Maps can also be used to find alternate routes when a road is closed or congested. Additionally, maps can be used to plan the most efficient route between two points in a county. Maps are a great tool for viewing a county highway as a line and for planning travel or identifying attractions."}
