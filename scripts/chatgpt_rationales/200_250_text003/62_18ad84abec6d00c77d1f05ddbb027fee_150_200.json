It is found from Alaska and Canada down to northern Mexico. As its name implies, the bald eagle is bald, with a white head and tail feathers and brown body feathers. The bald eagle is most commonly found near large bodies of water, such as rivers, lakes, and oceans, where its primary food source, fish, can be found.\n\nSt. Paul, Minnesota is located in the Upper Midwest Region of the United States, along the banks of the Mississippi River. Because of its location along the river, St. Paul is a prime habitat for bald eagles. In fact, the Minnesota River Valley has been recognized as an important wintering site for bald eagles in the Midwest, with hundreds of eagles congregating in the area during the winter months.\n\nSo, if a bald eagle is flying over St. Paul, it is likely in Minnesota. This is because of the abundance of food and the suitable habitat for the bird. St. Paul is also home to several bald eagle nests and observation areas, making it an ideal place for the bird to live and thrive."}
