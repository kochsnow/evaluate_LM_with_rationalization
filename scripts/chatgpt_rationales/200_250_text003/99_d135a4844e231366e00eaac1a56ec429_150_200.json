Like a bicycle, it has one front wheel and one back wheel, each run by a chain.", "id": "d135a4844e231366e00eaac1a56ec429", "150_to_200_words": "\n\nA chain drive on a motorbike is used to transfer power from the engine to the back wheel. A chain is made up of a series of interlocking links and is looped around two sprockets, one attached to the engine and one on the back wheel. As the engine sprocket rotates, it causes the chain to move, which in turn rotates the sprocket attached to the back wheel, making it spin.\n\nLike a bicycle, a motorbike chain needs to be kept lubricated and tensioned in order to keep it from slipping or breaking. A motorbike chain is usually made of metal and is much stronger than a bicycle chain, as it needs to cope with higher levels of torque and power. It also needs to be able to withstand the vibrations and impacts of uneven roads and the wear and tear of more aggressive riding.\n\nThe chain drive system is more efficient than other types of transmission, such as a belt drive, as it has less friction and is better able to cope with high levels of power and torque. It also offers more flexibility when it comes to gear ratios and provides a smoother ride with better acceleration. In addition, a chain drive is relatively easy to maintain and repair, making it a popular choice for motorb"}
