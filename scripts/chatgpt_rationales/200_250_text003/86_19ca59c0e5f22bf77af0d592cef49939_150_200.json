Schools have libraries that are designed specifically for students of a certain age group, usually elementary, middle, and high school. These libraries are typically well stocked with books and other resources that are tailored to the age group of the students who use them. The books in the library are usually selected based on the interests and developmental level of the students, and the library staff can provide assistance in selecting materials that are appropriate for the students' needs. Additionally, the library may offer activities and programs that are tailored to the age group, such as story times and reading clubs.\n\nSchool libraries also provide students with access to computers and the internet, allowing them to search for information about a variety of topics.
