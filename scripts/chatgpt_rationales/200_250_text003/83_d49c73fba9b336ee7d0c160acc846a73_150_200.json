This is because the sun's rays are not as strong in the winter, so the air doesn't get as warm. The cold air causes the body to lose heat faster than it can be produced, making people feel cold.\n\nThe human body is equipped with a variety of ways to keep itself warm. For example, when it gets cold, the body will start to shiver in order to create heat. The body also maintains its core temperature by constricting the blood vessels in the skin, which reduces the amount of heat lost to the environment. But when the air is much colder than the body's temperature, these mechanisms can't keep up, so people start feeling cold.\n\nAnother reason why people may feel cold in the winter is because of the wind chill effect. When the wind blows, it removes the layer of warm air that is close to the body, so the body loses heat faster. This can make people feel colder than the actual air temperature.\n\nFinally, people may feel cold in the winter because of the lack of sunlight. Sunlight provides energy to the body in the form of Vitamin D, which helps the body regulate its temperature"}
