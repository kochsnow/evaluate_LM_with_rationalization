This is due to its placement in the solar system and its atmosphere. Earth receives the right amount of sunlight, and its atmosphere is breathable and contains the right combination of gases. Additionally, the planet's surface temperature is within a range that is suitable for plant growth. The presence of water, either in the form of oceans or as water vapor in the atmosphere, further aids in the growth of plants. \n\nPlants also need nutrients, which are found in the soil.
