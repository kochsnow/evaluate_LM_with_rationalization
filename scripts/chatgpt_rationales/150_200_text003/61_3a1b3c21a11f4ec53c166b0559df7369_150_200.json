This is due to access to the necessities of life, such as food, shelter, and a place to sleep. Bridges are especially attractive to those who are homeless, as they offer shelter, anonymity, and a sense of security. Bridges also provide access to food, as they are often located near restaurants, convenience stores, and other places to purchase food. Additionally, bridges are often close to public transportation, allowing bums to easily get to where they need to go. Finally, bridges provide an escape from the hustle and bustle of everyday life, allowing bums to find a sense of peace and tranquility. All of these factors make bridges the ideal place for John, the bum, to live."}
