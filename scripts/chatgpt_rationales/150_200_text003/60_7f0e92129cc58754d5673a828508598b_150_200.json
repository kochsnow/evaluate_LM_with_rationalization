This is because a sad tune has traditionally been used to express deep emotion, particularly sorrow and distress. It is often used as a way to convey feelings such as fear, sadness, or grief. Fiddling a sad tune is a way to represent these emotions musically. For example, a mournful violin solo can be used to express sorrow or sadness over a lost loved one. In the same way, a slow, melancholic melody can be used to illustrate feelings of sadness or distress. Overall, the purpose of a sad tune is to communicate a feeling of distress, which is why it is likely that the song is about troubles."}
