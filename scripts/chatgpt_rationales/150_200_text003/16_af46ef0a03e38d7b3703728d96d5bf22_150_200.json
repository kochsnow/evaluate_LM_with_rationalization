This is because being indoors usually means there is limited air circulation and the air can become stagnant. Stagnant air can be filled with dust, allergens, and other particles that can cause congestion, fatigue, headaches, and other ailments. Whereas, fresh air is clean and free of allergens, which can help people feel better physically and mentally. Fresh air also helps to reduce stress and anxiety, as it is naturally calming. Additionally, fresh air is energizing, which can help to make people feel more alert and awake. Finally, fresh air can help to improve overall mood and outlook, as it is invigorating and can increase endorphins, which are the body\u2019s natural feel-good chemicals. All in all, breathing fresh air after being stuck indoors all day can lead to feeling refreshed."}
