Due to moving, members of the band must carry their instruments.", "id": "9ec29f101f97d7d24b562e3af4df4c1b", "150_to_200_words": "\n\nMarching bands typically require players to carry their instruments while they play. This is due to the fact that the band must march and play at the same time, so the instruments must be portable. The brass instruments used in marching bands are typically smaller than those used in concert bands, and include instruments such as the trumpet, trombone, baritone, euphonium, and tuba. The marching band must also be able to move quickly and efficiently, which is why the brass instruments are designed for portability. Additionally, the marching band typically plays outdoors, so the instruments must be able to withstand the elements. Carrying the instruments allows the band to keep up with the beat and stay in sync. With the sound of the brass instruments leading the way, the marching band is able to keep their momentum and create a powerful, unified sound."}
