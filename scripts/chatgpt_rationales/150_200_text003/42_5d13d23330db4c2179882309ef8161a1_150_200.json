An unattached building provided extra space which could be used to construct the playroom without taking up space in the main living quarters. Having an unattached building also allows James to provide his children with a separate space in which to play, interact, and enjoy themselves outside of the main living area. This allows James to provide a safe, enclosed, and fun environment for his children to play in, free from the distractions of other people in the house. Additionally, an unattached building provides a sense of privacy, allowing James and his children to enjoy their playroom without the worry of being disrupted by other people. With an unattached building, James is able to create a safe and fun place for his children to play, without giving up much of the living area in his home."}
