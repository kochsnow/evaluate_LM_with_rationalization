{"stem": "Given question: Where does litter end up when it's tossed from a car? and answer: roadsides, explain why in", "no_more_50_words": "If one was to toss garbage from a moving car, because the car is likely to be driving along a road, the trash would likely end up a few feet away on the road side.", "id": "4151bfac702ee16a6f923cb5c28f0fff", "150_to_200_words": "\n\nLitter that is tossed from a car often ends up by the roadside. This is because when an item is thrown from a moving car, the wind carries it to the side of the road. The litter is then deposited onto the ground on the side of the road, which is the most common place for it to end up. Littering from a car makes it difficult to clean up, as the litter is spread out over a large area and is often difficult to reach. Additionally, littering from a car can be dangerous, as the litter can hit other drivers or pedestrians, or even cause a car accident. Littering also has an environmental impact, as it can damage the natural environment and wildlife. The litter can also attract pests, such as rodents, which can cause further damage to the environment. Therefore, it is best to not litter from cars and to dispose of items responsibly."}
