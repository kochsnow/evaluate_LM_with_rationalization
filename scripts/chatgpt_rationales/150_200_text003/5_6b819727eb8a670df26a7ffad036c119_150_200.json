A math problem is a question that requires finding an answer using mathematical terms and operations. In this case, the problem starts by stating the original amount of apples on the tree, 10. It then states that three apples fell off, leaving only the answer of how many apples are now on the tree left to be found. Math problems can often be solved by writing an equation that adds, subtracts, multiplies, or divides numbers to find the answer. In this case, the equation would be \"10 - 3 = X\". This equation can be solved by subtracting 3 from 10, which would result in 7 apples. Therefore, the answer to the problem is that there are now 7 apples on the tree. Math problems such as this one are important for helping people understand how different numbers can be manipulated and combined in order to find an answer."}
