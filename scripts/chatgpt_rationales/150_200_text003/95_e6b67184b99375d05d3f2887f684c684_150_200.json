He had enjoyed the weeks of doing nothing and was feeling great when it was time to go back. After the treatment he was painless, meaning he was not feeling any physical or mental discomfort or distress. This meant he was in a much better state of mind than he had been before the treatment, and he was able to focus on his work without any distractions. Having gone through this difficult experience, Dan was feeling a sense of relief and accomplishment, which in turn made it easier for him to transition back into his job. The fact that he was painless was a major contributing factor to why he was able to return to work without any trouble."}
