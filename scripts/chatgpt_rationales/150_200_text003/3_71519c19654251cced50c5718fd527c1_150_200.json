A cup is the most convenient and versatile way to get a beverage. A cup can hold hot or cold liquids, so I can enjoy a hot cup of coffee for breakfast or a cold glass of iced tea for lunch. Having a cup also allows me to measure out the right amount of liquid I need. I can also control how much sugar or other additives I add to my drink by measuring it into the cup. Plus, cups are reusable and can be washed easily, so I don't have to worry about drinking out of a single-use container. On top of that, cups come in a variety of styles, colors, and sizes, so I can find one that fits my needs and tastes. This makes it easy to take my favorite drinks on the go. Cups are a practical and stylish choice for getting a drink."}
