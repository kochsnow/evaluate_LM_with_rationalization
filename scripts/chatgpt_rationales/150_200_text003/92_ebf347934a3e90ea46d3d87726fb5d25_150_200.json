A pastor manages his church's property. If he is zoning the graveyard, it must be on his church's property. ", "id": "ebf347934a3e90ea46d3d87726fb5d25", "150_to_200_words": "\n\nThe graveyard was zoned by the pastor because it was located on church property. The church typically owns a large plot of land that contains a church building and cemetery. The pastor is responsible for ensuring that the cemetery is managed properly and that it is a respectful place for the deceased and their loved ones. The pastor is likely to have designated an area of the church property for the graveyard, to ensure that it is kept separate from other areas. This zoning ensures that the graveyard is a quiet and respectful place for the deceased, and that it is not disturbed by other activities. The pastor may also have set rules for the graveyard, such as who can enter, what types of activities are allowed, and who is responsible for its upkeep. By zoning the graveyard, the pastor can ensure that it is managed in a respectful and orderly manner, and that it is a place of peace and reflection."}
