It is the part of the property that faces the street, and it is typically used for decorative purposes. It can include landscaping, such as flower beds, shrubs, trees, and other plants. It is also commonly used for outdoor activities, such as playing games or relaxing in the sun. It is usually larger than the backyard, which is often used for more functional purposes, such as vegetable and herb gardens, play areas, and other utility uses. A front yard is usually well-manicured, which helps maintain the look of the neighborhood and can increase property values. It is also often the first impression people have of the house, so taking care of the front yard is important."}
