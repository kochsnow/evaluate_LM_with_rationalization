This can be caused by snow becoming heavy, because gravity will pull the snow downward.", "id": "47f60340b869552e795fa6782224f3d2", "150_to_200_words": "\n\nWhen snow accumulates on a mountain, it becomes heavy over time. This can cause the snow to become unstable and cause an avalanche. Avalanches occur when the weight of the snow becomes too much for the mountain to hold. This causes the snow to break apart and flow down the mountain quickly, resulting in a powerful force of snow, ice, rocks and debris. Avalanches can be triggered by strong winds, rapid snowfall, or a sudden change in temperature. Avalanches usually occur on steep slopes, and can spread out over a wide area, creating dangerous conditions for hikers and skiiers below. Avalanches also can cause destruction to roads, trails, and other structures in their path. It is important to be aware of avalanche danger and take safety precautions before heading out in the mountains."}
