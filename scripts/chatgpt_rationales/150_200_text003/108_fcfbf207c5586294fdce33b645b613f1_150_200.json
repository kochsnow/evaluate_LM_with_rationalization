Rain clouds are created when warm air rises and cools, forming condensation. This condensation is what we see in the sky as clouds. When the condensation gets heavy enough, it forms drops of water, which then fall back to the ground as rain. Rain clouds are composed of tiny droplets of water and ice crystals. These droplets and crystals form in the sky when warm air rises, cools, and condenses around tiny particles of dust, dirt, and salt. As the air rises and cools further, the droplets and crystals grow until they are too heavy to stay in the sky and fall back to the ground as rain. Rain clouds provide the majority of water for the earth's surface and are an essential part of the water cycle."}
