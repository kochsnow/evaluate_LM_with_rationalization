Moving backwards, the enemy would be forced to retreat and regroup, allowing the attacking force to gain significant ground before the enemy could respond. Additionally, driving the enemy backwards would limit the enemy\u2019s ability to form efficient defensive tactics. This would put the attacking force at a distinct advantage since there would be less time for the enemy to coordinate a response. Furthermore, by driving the enemy backwards, the attacking force could take advantage of any obstacles or defensive structures that may have been previously established by the enemy. This would give the attacking force an even greater edge in the battle and could potentially lead to a decisive victory."}
