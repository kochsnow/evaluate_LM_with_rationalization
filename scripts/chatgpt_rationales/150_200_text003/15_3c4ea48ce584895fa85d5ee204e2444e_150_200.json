Honesty requires truthfulness, which can be difficult for someone who wants to manipulate or deceive others. Acting without pretense requires being open and genuine, which goes against the bad person's need to deceive. Being sincere means to be genuine and authentic, something a bad person has no interest in. They would rather pretend to have certain qualities or values in order to get what they want. They do not care about being honest, open or sincere because these qualities are not important to them. Instead, they prioritize their own desires and will do whatever it takes to get what they want. They lack a moral compass and have no problem lying or manipulating others in order to get ahead."}
