Maps can be viewed in a variety of ways depending on the type of map. For example, a road map can give a detailed view of a county highway, including its location, direction, and other features such as nearby cities and towns, points of interest, and more. It can also show the highway's distance and elevation relative to other roads and highways. Satellite imagery can also be used to view a county highway as a line, as it can show a detailed view of the terrain, including hills, valleys, and other features of the landscape. Interactive maps can also be used to view a county highway as a line, as they provide a 3-D view of the terrain and can be used to zoom in and out to get a better view of the road. Finally, Google Maps and other online mapping services can also be used to view a county highway as a line, as they provide detailed maps of the surrounding area and can be used to get directions and other information about the road."}
