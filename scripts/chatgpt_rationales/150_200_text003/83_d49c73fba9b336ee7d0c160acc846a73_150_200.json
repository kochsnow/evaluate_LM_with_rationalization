The average winter temperature is usually lower than the average temperature of other seasons, making it difficult to stay warm. This is especially true if you live in an area with severe winters. As the temperature drops, the air becomes colder and less humid. This causes the body to lose its natural heat faster and make it harder to maintain a comfortable temperature. People may also feel colder if they are in areas that are exposed to wind and snow. Wind chill can make the temperature feel much lower than it actually is, making it difficult to stay warm. Some people may also feel colder if they do not have enough winter clothing or if they are not adequately prepared for the cold weather. All of these factors can make people feel cold during the winter season."}
