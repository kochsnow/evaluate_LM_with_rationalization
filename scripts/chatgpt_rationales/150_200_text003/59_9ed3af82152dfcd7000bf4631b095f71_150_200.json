Running is a form of cardiovascular exercise that increases the heart rate and breathing rate, causing the body to work harder than when at rest. This increase in activity can cause a person to become fatigued as their muscles have to work harder to keep up with the pace. Depending on the intensity of the run, the person may also experience muscle soreness or cramping due to the strain placed on the muscles.\n\nThe body also expends a lot of energy during a run, which can lead to feelings of tiredness. In order to keep up with the physical demands of running, the body has to use up its stores of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins for energy. Once these energy stores are depleted, fatigue sets in. Additionally, the body loses fluids and electrolytes as it sweats, which can lead to dehydration and further tiredness.\n\nIn conclusion, running can leave someone feeling tired due to the physical strain and energy expenditure it requires. This is normal and should be expected after a run."}
