In most religions, people come together in a physical building or space to practice their faith. This space is often referred to as a church. It is used to pray, meditate, listen to sermons, and sing hymns. When the electricity went out, people were still in the church because it is the place they go to practice their faith. Without electricity, they couldn't see each other, but they could still hear each other and feel the presence of the faith community. Even though they couldn't see, people used their other senses to focus on the spiritual aspects of their faith. They prayed, sang, and listened to the sermons. In that moment, the darkness was filled with the light of faith and love."}
