This is because deep-fried foods are a favorite among many people, so restaurants must use a large amount of oil to keep up with the demand. By using gallons of oil each week, the restaurant can ensure that its customers will always have enough food available to them. Additionally, since deep-fried foods require a large amount of oil, the restaurant must stock up on a lot of oil each week to ensure that the food is always cooked properly and to the customer's liking. The oil also helps to keep the fryers clean, which is important for the restaurant's reputation and for food safety. Ultimately, the deep fryers used gallons and gallons of oil a week because the location was the busiest restaurant in town, helping it to provide customers with tasty, deep-fried food."}
