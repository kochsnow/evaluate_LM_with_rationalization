People can be so desperate to save money that they become aggressive and resort to physical confrontation. The desire to get a good deal can also lead to a sense of entitlement, where they feel they are entitled to the item or service and will do whatever it takes to get it. They may also be competing with others to get the item or service, leading to physical altercations. People may also fight each other out of fear that if they don't get the item or service, someone else will, leading to a sense of desperation. Finally, people may fight each other for the thrill of the chase. Fighting for something that is highly desired can be an adrenaline rush for some people, leading them to act impulsively and recklessly."}
