The use of alcohol can lead to physical health risks, such as liver damage, and can increase the risk of developing diseases such as cancer. Additionally, underage drinking can lead to mental health problems, such as depression and anxiety, and can increase the risk of developing substance use disorders in the future. Furthermore, alcohol use can impair judgment and increase the chance of engaging in risky behaviors such as driving while intoxicated, which can lead to injury or death. Finally, because alcohol affects the brain\u2019s development, drinking during the teenage years can lead to long-term cognitive impairment, such as memory problems and difficulty concentrating.\n\nFor all of these reasons, it is illegal for minors to purchase alcohol, as this would increase the chances of them engaging in potentially harmful behavior. To ensure that minors are safe from the potential risks of alcohol use, the government has set a legal drinking age of 21. This age limit is intended to help protect young people from the potential harms of alcohol consumption."}
