This is because cats will often adjust their posture in order to ensure that it is as comfortable as possible. Cats are particularly sensitive to the temperature and the texture of their sleeping surface, so they will often find a spot that is warm and soft to lay on. In addition, cats will also often curl up into a ball when sleeping to create a sense of security, which is why they may be found snuggled into a corner of the couch or tucked away in a quiet corner of the room. Cats are also known to be very agile and flexible, so they can easily adjust their body position in order to find the most comfortable spot. Finally, cats have a natural instinct to feel safe and secure while sleeping, which is why they will often look for a spot that offers them shelter and protection from the outside world. All of these factors make it clear why cats will often lay in a comfortable position when they want to sleep."}
