This was to ensure that everyone received an equal opportunity to showcase their talent and have their voices heard. This rule was also set in place to ensure fairness to all the contestants and to give each contestant a chance to demonstrate what they had to offer. Each contestant was given an equal amount of time to perform their song, which allowed each one to display their singing abilities and show their potential to the judges and audience. This system enabled the judges to evaluate all the contestants and their performances more objectively and accurately. It also allowed the audience to get a better understanding of each contestant's style and performance, further helping the judges with their decisions. By having all the contestants wait their turn to sing, American Idol was able to create a fair and equal system that allowed each contestant an opportunity to shine, regardless of their experience or popularity."}
