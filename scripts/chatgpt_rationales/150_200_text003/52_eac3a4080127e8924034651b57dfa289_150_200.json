{"stem": "Given question: James shaved, but this left a lot of hair where? and answer: sink, explain why in", "no_more_50_words": "People usually shave at the sink, and shaving leaves behind discarded hair.", "id": "eac3a4080127e8924034651b57dfa289", "150_to_200_words": "\n\nJames likely shaved where he normally does, which is usually in the bathroom. After shaving, the tiny hairs from the razor can end up in the sink. This often happens because the sink is usually the most convenient place for a person to shave in the bathroom, and it\u2019s very easy for the small hairs to fall into the sink without the person noticing. The sink also has a curved shape, which makes it easy for the hairs to accumulate in certain areas. Over time, this can lead to a lot of hair in the sink, especially if the person shaves often. It\u2019s also important to note that the sink isn\u2019t the only place where hair can end up after someone shaves. Hair can end up on the counter, floor, or even in the shower. However, the sink is the most common place for hair to accumulate after a person shaves."}
