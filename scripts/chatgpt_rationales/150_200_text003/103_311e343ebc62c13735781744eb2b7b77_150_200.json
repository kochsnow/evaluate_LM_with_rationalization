Packaged corn is pre-prepared by grocery store employees, so it is generally more expensive.", "id": "311e343ebc62c13735781744eb2b7b77", "150_to_200_words": "\n\nThe main reason Sam and June bought loose corn is because it was less expensive than packaged corn. Packaged corn is typically more expensive because it requires extra labor and materials for the packaging. Packaged corn also requires additional shipping costs to transport it to the store. Additionally, since packaged corn is a processed food, it typically contains added preservatives, which increases the cost. Loose corn, on the other hand, is simply raw corn that has been harvested directly from the field. It does not require packaging, nor does it require any additional preservatives, which makes it cheaper than packaged corn. Additionally, loose corn is typically fresher than packaged corn, as it has not been sitting on shelves for an extended period of time. Ultimately, Sam and June decided to purchase loose corn because it was more affordable than packaged corn and was fresher."}
