A postal service can perform delivery, saving the company time and resources.", "id": "1dbfb41e04a10bdbb085bfe667c0df99", "150_to_200_words": "\n\nOne way a company can efficiently sell things to their customers is through mail order. Mail order is a system that allows customers to purchase products online or through catalogs, with the items being shipped directly to them. This provides a convenient way for customers to shop without having to leave their homes. It also allows companies to reach a wider audience, as customers from all over the world can order products from them. Additionally, customers can view detailed descriptions and images of products, as well as read reviews from other customers, making it easier for them to make an informed decision about what to buy. In addition, mail order allows companies to process orders more quickly and efficiently, as they are able to process orders much faster than in a traditional retail setting. Finally, mail order can also help companies reduce their costs, as they don't have to pay for a physical store, staff, and other overhead costs associated with running a retail business. All of these factors make mail order an efficient way for companies to sell their products to customers."}
