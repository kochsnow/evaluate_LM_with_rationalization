Sharks use their gills to extract the salt from the water that they swim in. In freshwater, the concentration of salt is much lower than in saltwater, so sharks are unable to extract enough salt to maintain their osmotic balance. If a shark is unable to do this, it will become dehydrated and its cells will begin to break down. Sharks also have a unique ability to sense electric fields, which they use to locate their prey. This ability is diminished in freshwater, making it difficult for the shark to find food. Therefore, it is essential for a shark to be in saltwater in order to survive and thrive."}
