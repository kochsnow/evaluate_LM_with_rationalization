Where might he be? and answer: airplane, explain why in", "no_more_50_words": "An airplane is a place with very close contact with other passengers, and it is where you might transmit germs to others, when you have a cold. John might need a tissue from the tissue holder to blow his nose for his cold to prevent transmitting germs.", "id": "388dada77986465f8e46410bd8a89d0e", "150_to_200_words": "\n\nJohn may be on an airplane if he asked for a tissue holder because he had a cold. This is because airplanes commonly have tissue holders in the bathrooms and in the seatback pockets in front of passengers. Airlines also provide passengers with tissues, usually in the seatback pockets, to help with any nose irritation that may arise while they are in-flight. \n\nAirplanes have to meet certain health and safety regulations, so the tissue holders and tissues are necessary. The tissue holders are there to help keep the bathrooms clean and to provide a sanitary place for passengers to dispose of their used tissues. The tissues are there to help reduce the spread of germs, which is especially important when people are in close quarters for an extended period of time. \n\nJohn may have been aware of the tissue holders and tissues on airplanes, and so he asked for one when he had a cold. This is also a good idea for anyone who has a cold, as it helps to keep their germs contained and limits the spread of their germs to other passengers."}
