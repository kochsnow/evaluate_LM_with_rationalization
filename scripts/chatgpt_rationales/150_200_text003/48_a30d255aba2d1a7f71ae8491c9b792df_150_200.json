The chain is connected to the gearbox, which is powered by a petrol engine. This chain then rotates the back wheel, which propels the motorbike forward. The chain is essential for the motorbike to move and is the most efficient way to transfer the power from the engine to the wheel.\n\nThe chain is made up of metal parts, including links and sprockets. The links are connected to each other and form a loop, while the sprockets are toothed wheels which grip onto the chain. The sprockets on the gearbox and the back wheel are connected by the chain, and when the gearbox is engaged, the sprockets rotate, causing the chain to move. This movement is then transferred to the back wheel, causing the motorbike to move forward.\n\nThe chain is a durable and efficient way of transferring the power from the engine to the back wheel, and is why most motorbikes use a chain. It is also a relatively inexpensive and straightforward system, making it a popular choice for motorbikes."}
