It is often used to connect major cities and is often used to cross borders. In the United States, an expressway can leave the US and go to Canada. This is because the US has a close relationship with Canada, and there is a long-standing border crossing agreement in place between the two countries. The expressway will likely follow the highway system that has been established between the two countries, as well as any additional routes that have been added to facilitate a smoother flow of traffic between the two countries. Additionally, there are several border crossings that are in place to allow for easier passage between the two countries.
