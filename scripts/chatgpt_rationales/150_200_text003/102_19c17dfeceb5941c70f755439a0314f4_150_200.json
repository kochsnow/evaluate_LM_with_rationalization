Lift is produced by the shape and speed of the plane. When an airplane moves through the air, the shape of the wings and the speed of the plane help to create an area of low air pressure above the wing, and a higher air pressure below the wing. This difference in pressure causes a force, known as lift, which pushes the plane up into the sky. The faster the plane moves, the more lift it produces, and the higher it can go. The engine of the plane also helps to provide thrust, which is the force that moves the plane forward and helps it to stay in the air. Therefore, airplanes usually go into the sky because the combination of lift and thrust that the plane produces allows it to fly."}
