So, it might be difficult to learn French without being exposed to it (by studying, or living in a French-speaking country).", "id": "f191f283d891fc8a17459ff0d077ac55", "150_to_200_words": "\n\nJames had difficulty learning the French language because he never had any exposure to it. Exposure is a key factor in learning a language. Without exposure to a language, it is difficult to learn the basics and build upon that knowledge. Exposure involves hearing the language spoken, seeing it written, and having opportunities to practice and use the language in a meaningful way. Without exposure, the learner is unable to get a sense of the language, the pronunciation, and the grammar that is necessary for fluency.\n\nJames may have had access to French language materials, but without exposure to the language, he would not have been able to gain an understanding of how to use the language. He may have been able to learn some individual words and phrases, but without being able to hear and see the language in an authentic context, it was difficult for him to understand the rules of the language and how to combine words to create sentences and meaningful conversations.\n\nExposure is a critical part of language learning, and it is necessary for the learner to be able to gain a true understanding of the language. Without exposure, James was unable to make meaningful progress in learning the French language."}
