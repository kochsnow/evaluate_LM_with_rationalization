Index cards are used to help organize and store information in a library, such as book titles, authors, and topics of interest. They are also used to help library patrons locate books, as they contain brief summaries of the books as well as call numbers to identify the book's location. Index cards are also used in libraries to organize reference materials, such as encyclopedias, dictionaries, and atlases. Having index cards on display in a museum would provide the opportunity for patrons to learn about the utility of index cards and the function of libraries, as well as the power of knowledge and information. Additionally, index cards can be used to create art, and displaying them in a museum would provide people with the opportunity to explore the creative possibilities of index cards."}
