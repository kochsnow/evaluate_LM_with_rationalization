{"stem": "Given question: The person was cold and wet, where should he go? and answer: building, explain why in", "no_more_50_words": "An indoor space (with heaters, blankets, and warm showers) is likely to be warmer than this outdoor one, where the person became cold and wet.", "id": "ae12d001cc347a623202114b89db35f1", "150_to_200_words": "\n\nThe person should go to a building if they are cold and wet. Being cold and wet can be dangerous, as it can lead to hypothermia or other health issues. A building can provide shelter from the elements, and a chance to warm up and dry off. Depending on the type of building, it may also have access to a bathroom, a place to change clothes, and other amenities.\n\nFor safety reasons, the person should try to find a public building if possible. This could be a library, community center, or other public facility. These buildings are staffed and monitored, so there is less risk of encountering any dangerous situations.\n\nThe person should also avoid entering any private buildings without permission. This could be seen as trespassing, and the person could be arrested or fined for doing so.\n\nNo matter what kind of building the person chooses to enter, they should always be aware of their surroundings. This means avoiding any areas that look unsafe, such as dark hallways or isolated areas. If possible, the person should also try to find a staff member or security guard and tell them what happened so they can be helped."}
