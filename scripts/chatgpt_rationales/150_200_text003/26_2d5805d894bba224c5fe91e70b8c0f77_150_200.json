{"stem": "Given question: A car was going from Florida to Ohio, what was it doing? and answer: heading north, explain why in", "no_more_50_words": "Florida is to the south of Ohio, and you need to drive north to go from Florida to Ohio.", "id": "2d5805d894bba224c5fe91e70b8c0f77", "150_to_200_words": "\n\nThe car was heading north because Ohio is located in the northern region of the United States and Florida is located in the southern region. Ohio is located above Florida, so when travelling from Florida to Ohio, the car must travel north. Ohio is located in the Midwest, along with other states such as Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, and Wisconsin. All of these states are located north of Florida. \n\nThe car is likely travelling on an interstate such as I-75 or I-95. I-75 is the main highway that runs north to south through the eastern United States and I-95 is the main highway that runs north to south along the eastern coast. Both of these highways start in Florida and continue north, eventually ending in Ohio. \n\nUltimately, the car was heading north because Ohio is located in the northern region of the United States and is above Florida. The car was most likely travelling on an interstate such as I-75 or I-95, which both start in Florida and end in Ohio."}
