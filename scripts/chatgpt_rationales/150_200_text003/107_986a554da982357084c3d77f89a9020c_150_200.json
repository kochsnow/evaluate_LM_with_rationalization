This generally requires a subject in the form of a noun, and a verb.", "id": "986a554da982357084c3d77f89a9020c", "150_to_200_words": "\n\nA sentence is a string of words that conveys a complete thought. A sentence must have at least one subject, which is usually a noun, and one verb. The subject is the person, place, thing, or idea the sentence is about, and the verb is an action that the subject is doing. For example, in the sentence \"John ran,\" \"John\" is the subject and \"ran\" is the verb. A proper noun is a type of noun that refers to a specific person, place, or thing. For example, \"John\" is a proper noun because it refers to a specific person. A proper noun and a verb together form a sentence. \"John ran\" is an example of a sentence that contains a proper noun and a verb. A sentence can also contain additional words, such as adjectives and adverbs, that provide more information about the subject and verb."}
