Swimming pools are designed to provide a safe area to swim and play in a backyard setting. Generally, swimming pools are at least 3.5 feet deep, and they can go up to 8 feet or more depending on size and purpose. The depth of the pool is necessary to allow swimmers to move freely and safely. With shallow water, there may not be enough space to move freely without fear of hitting the bottom of the pool. Additionally, shallow water is not suitable for diving, which is an important part of having fun in the pool. Diving boards and slides require a certain depth of water in order to be used safely. Without a sufficient depth of water, these features are unable to be used, limiting the fun that can be had in the pool. Furthermore, shallow water can easily become too warm, which can create a less than enjoyable swimming experience. Therefore, shallow water would not make for much fun in a backyard swimming pool."}
