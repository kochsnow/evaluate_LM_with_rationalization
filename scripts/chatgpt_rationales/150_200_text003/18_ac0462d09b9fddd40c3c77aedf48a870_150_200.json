{"stem": "Given question: John runs a small corner shop.   If you were walking on a sidewalk near it, where would you look for it? and answer: street corner, explain why in", "no_more_50_words": "Corner shops often are run out of buildings on street corners.", "id": "ac0462d09b9fddd40c3c77aedf48a870", "150_to_200_words": "\n\nJohn's small corner shop would be located on a street corner. It's not uncommon for a small corner shop to be located at an intersection of two streets and situated in the corner of the intersection. This is advantageous for a business such as John's since it offers more access to customers. People walking on the sidewalk near the shop would be able to easily spot it because it would be more visible due to being exposed on two sides. The shop would also be more accessible as it is located in a more central location and easier to reach. Moreover, a street corner location is usually more convenient for customers because it would provide more opportunities to park their cars or bikes nearby. Furthermore, by being located at a street corner, John's small corner shop would be less likely to be overlooked by pedestrians passing by, as it would be more visible from both sides of the street, unlike a shop located in the middle of a street. All these factors would make it easier for people walking on the sidewalk near the shop to locate it."}
