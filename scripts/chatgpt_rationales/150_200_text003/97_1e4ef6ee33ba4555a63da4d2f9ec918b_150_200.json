Sails fill with wind. ", "id": "1e4ef6ee33ba4555a63da4d2f9ec918b", "150_to_200_words": "\n\nThe calm seas weren't going to stay that way long, their sails filled as it got windy. Windy conditions are necessary to propel a sailboat along the water. Sails require wind to fill them and push the boat forward. The wind is created by air molecules moving in a particular direction and this motion is known as wind. When the wind is blowing in a certain direction, the sails of a sailboat fill with air and the boat moves forward. A boat will not move if there is no wind because the sails will not fill. Windy conditions are ideal for sailing, allowing the boat to move quickly and efficiently. Without wind, sailboats would be unable to move and the crew would be unable to reach their destination. Windy conditions are also essential for a variety of other activities such as windsurfing, kiteboarding, and parasailing. Without wind, these activities would not be possible. Therefore, it is clear that windy conditions are essential for sailing and a variety of other activities. This explains why the calm seas weren't going to stay that way long, their sails filled as it got windy."}
