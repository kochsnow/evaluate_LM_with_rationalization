St. Paul is the capital city of Minnesota, so it is very likely that a bald eagle could be seen flying over the city. Bald Eagles are often found near bodies of water such as lakes, rivers, and oceans, and Minnesota is bordered by Lake Superior and other large bodies of water, which could provide an ideal habitat for bald eagles. Additionally, Minnesota is home to large national forests, which could also offer the perfect conditions for the bird to hunt and nest. In short, it is very likely that a bald eagle could be seen flying over St. Paul, Minnesota."}
