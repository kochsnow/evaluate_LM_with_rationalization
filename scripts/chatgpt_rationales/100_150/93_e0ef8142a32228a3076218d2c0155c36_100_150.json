Toll roads are roads that charge a fee to travel on them and this money is used to maintain and upgrade the road's infrastructure. The revenue generated from tolls can be used to repair and resurface roads, build new roads, add lanes, construct new bridges, and install traffic signals. This ensures a safe and efficient flow of traffic, as well as improved road conditions. Additionally, the money collected from tolls can be used to make improvements to the overall safety of the roads, such as constructing guardrails, resurfacing shoulders, and adding rumble strips. All of these improvements help to make the roads safer and easier to travel on. Ultimately, the money collected from tolls is used to keep the roads in good repair, which helps to ensure the safety of all drivers."}
