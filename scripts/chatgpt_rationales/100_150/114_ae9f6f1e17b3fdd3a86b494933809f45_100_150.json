Libraries are institutions dedicated to the preservation and archiving of books, periodicals, and other written or printed materials. Index cards are usually used as a cataloguing tool to help organize and keep track of the books in the library. Additionally, index cards are often used to provide a brief description of the content of a book, which can help patrons find the materials they are looking for. They are also used to record information about a library's patrons, such as their contact details, borrowing history, and payment details. Index cards are an essential part of the library's operations, which is why they would be on display at a library museum."}
