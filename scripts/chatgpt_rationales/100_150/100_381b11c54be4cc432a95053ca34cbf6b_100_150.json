This is a natural instinct as animals are hardwired to survive and will do whatever it takes to protect themselves. Flight is not always an option as the animal may be cornered or unable to escape. In this situation, animals will use fight as a way to defend themselves. This can manifest in many forms, such as using sharp claws or teeth to ward off predators, or even feigning death in order to scare off the attacker. By fighting for its life, the animal is able to defend itself, which increases its chances of survival. This is a natural response that has been passed down through thousands of years of evolution."}
