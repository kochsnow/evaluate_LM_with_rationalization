This typically means curling up into a tight ball or stretching out in a long, low position. Cats also often like to sleep in spots where they can feel safe and protected, such as in a bed, on shelves, couches, chairs, or boxes. When cats curl up in a ball, it helps them conserve body heat, which helps keep them warm. Additionally, cats often like to sleep in a spot where they can observe their environment, such as near a window or in an elevated spot. This allows them to feel secure by allowing them to keep an eye out for potential predators or other threats. All of these factors help cats feel comfortable and relaxed, which allows them to get the rest that they need."}
