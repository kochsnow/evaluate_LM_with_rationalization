Playing in shallow water would be limited to activities such as splashing around, which wouldn't provide a whole lot of entertainment. A swimming pool would provide more recreational opportunities, as it would be deep enough for a variety of activities such as swimming, diving, and playing water games. Additionally, a swimming pool would be able to be easily chlorinated and cleaned, meaning it would be a much more hygienic option compared to a body of shallow water. A swimming pool would also be more aesthetically pleasing than a body of shallow water, as it could be decorated with tiles and other features. In conclusion, a swimming pool is a much more suitable choice for summer fun in the backyard than shallow water."}
