This report is often referred to as an offense report, incident report, or police report. The report is used to document the officer's account of the crime or incident, including details such as the date, time and location of the event, the names of any witnesses, victims or suspects, and any evidence collected. The report also includes the officer's narrative of what happened, as well as other pertinent information obtained from the investigation. The report is then submitted to a supervisor for review and approval. Case reports are important tools for police officers, as they provide a written record of the event for future reference, allow the officer to explain his or her actions, and help to create a chain of evidence for criminal proceedings. They also provide a way for supervisors to evaluate the officer's performance."}
