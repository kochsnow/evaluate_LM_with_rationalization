Restaurants go through a lot of oil when deep frying foods, as they must use a sufficient amount of oil in the fryers so that the food is cooked properly. This is especially true for a busy restaurant, as they need to keep up with the demand of customers and make sure the food is cooked right. The more customers that come in, the more often the fryers need to be refilled with oil. Furthermore, a busy restaurant will usually have more menu items that need to be cooked in a deep fryer, which increases the amount of oil used. All in all, this explains why the deep fryers used gallons and gallons of oil a week - because the location was the busiest restaurant in town."}
