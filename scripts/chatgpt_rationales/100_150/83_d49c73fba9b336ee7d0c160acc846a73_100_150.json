This is due to the decrease in sunlight, which results in the atmosphere losing heat. The cold temperatures cause people to experience physical sensations such as shivering, feeling chilled, and an overall decrease in body temperature. People may also feel more lethargic, due to the lower temperatures, and may even find it more difficult to concentrate. Additionally, the winter months can also cause people to feel more depressed due to the lack of sunlight and the shorter days. For these reasons, people typically feel cold in the winter, and it is important to stay warm and bundle up during these colder months."}
