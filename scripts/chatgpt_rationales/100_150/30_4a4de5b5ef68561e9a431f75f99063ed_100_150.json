Where was he? and answer: hotel, explain why in", "no_more_50_words": "Hotels are places where people sleep for a few nights when they are travelling, and so it's often the case that hotel guests would be unfamiliar with their room. Given that travellers are unfamiliar with the location, losing items, for example in a night stand, might be more common.", "id": "4a4de5b5ef68561e9a431f75f99063ed", "100_to_150_words": "\n\nJohn was likely staying in a hotel. Hotels often have night tables in each room, which is why he may have placed something on the night table. If he forgot about it in the morning, it is likely because he was unfamiliar with the hotel room and its contents. This suggests that he was in a place that he was not familiar with, and that he had not been in the place for very long. Since hotels are often the places people stay when they are travelling or visiting a place for a short amount of time, it is likely that John was staying in a hotel. This would explain why he was unfamiliar with the night table and why he forgot about the item he had placed there."}
