The two had to come to the difficult decision to end their marriage, and it was a decision that was no doubt filled with sadness. There were many emotions they were feeling as they went through the process of legally ending their marriage. They were likely feeling regret for things that didn't work out between them, guilt for ending the marriage, and sadness for the loss of the relationship. They may have also been feeling a sense of relief that the decision had been made, but that relief would likely be tinged with the sadness that the marriage had not worked out. Even when the divorce is amicable, it is still a difficult situation to go through, and the sadness that James and Ruth were feeling was likely a major emotion that they were experiencing."}
