This is because the force of the wind, as well as the speed at which the car is travelling, can cause the litter to be thrown far away from the car and onto the roadside. Additionally, the litter can be blown out of the car window and end up on the side of the road. Litter thrown from the car can also fall into roadside ditches, making it difficult to clean up. In some cases, the litter can even enter storm drains and end up in waterways, creating environmental hazards. In any case, when litter is carelessly tossed from a car, it often ends up on the roadsides, making it difficult to clean up and posing a potential risk to the environment."}
