Telephone directories are usually found in public places such as phone booths. The purpose of a phone booth is to provide a private space for people to make calls. The phone booth is often equipped with a telephone directory so that people can look up numbers and addresses. This is particularly useful for people who don't have access to a home phone or mobile device. The directory also contains emergency contact information that can be used in case of an emergency. By having a telephone directory, it allows people to easily access phone numbers and contact information wherever they are. This is especially helpful for people who are visiting a new area and need to find information quickly."}
