Packaged corn is pre-prepared by grocery store employees, so it is generally more expensive.", "id": "311e343ebc62c13735781744eb2b7b77", "100_to_150_words": "\n\nSam and June chose to buy loose corn because it was less expensive than the packaged variety. Loose corn does not come in a package or container, so the cost to package the corn is eliminated. Additionally, the costs associated with storing and shipping the packaged corn are reduced when it is sold in bulk. The price of corn is often lower in bulk, so buying loose corn is a more cost-efficient option. Furthermore, loose corn is often fresher than packaged corn because it has not been sitting on a shelf for a long period of time. Fresh produce is generally more nutrient-dense and flavorful, making loose corn a better quality product. Ultimately, Sam and June chose to purchase loose corn because it was a more cost-effective and higher-quality product than the packaged variety."}
