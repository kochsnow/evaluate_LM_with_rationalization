I'm not sure what she's doing, but I can tell it's something important to her. She's always looking at her phone, checking messages and scrolling through her social media. It's clear that she values her phone and the connection it provides to other people. She loves to keep in touch with her friends and family, which is why she's always on her phone. She also likes to share her life with other people, so it's likely that she's posting photos, videos, and stories of what she's doing. I think it's great that she's able to stay connected to the people she loves, even when she's away from them. It's amazing that technology has allowed for such a close connection between people, no matter the distance."}
