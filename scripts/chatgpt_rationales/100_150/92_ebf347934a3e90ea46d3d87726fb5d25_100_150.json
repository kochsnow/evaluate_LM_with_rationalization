A pastor manages his church's property. If he is zoning the graveyard, it must be on his church's property.

The pastor likely chose to zone the graveyard on church property for several reasons. Firstly, it would be easier to maintain and manage the graveyard if it was located on property controlled by the church. Secondly, it would provide the church with full control over the graveyard, ensuring that it is kept to the highest of standards, and providing peace of mind that only church members and those invited by church members would have access to the graveyard. Lastly, it would be a fitting and respectful way to honor and remember those who have passed away, as well as providing a place for others to pay their respects. The church also has the resources and funds to properly maintain and manage the graveyard, making it a wise decision to zone it on church property."}
