This is because mouthwash helps to keep the mouth clean and free from bacteria, which is important for oral hygiene. The dentist or hygienist will usually give the patient a little paper cup filled with mouthwash and instruct them to swish it around in their mouth before spitting it out. This helps to kill any bacteria or food particles that may be stuck in between teeth, on the tongue, or on the gums. The mouthwash also helps to freshen breath and can make the patient's mouth feel cleaner and more refreshed. Mouthwash can also help to reduce plaque buildup, which can cause cavities, tooth decay, and gum disease. By receiving mouthwash in a little paper cup at the dentist\u2019s office, patients are given the opportunity to take care of their oral health by cleaning their mouths and reducing the bacteria in their mouths."}
