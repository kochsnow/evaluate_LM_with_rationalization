This is because the shark's body is unable to regulate the ions on its own. In saltwater, the osmotic pressure of the water is greater than the osmotic pressure in the shark's body, so saltwater enters the shark's body and causes the concentration of ions to rise. In freshwater, the osmotic pressure is lower, so the shark would lose ions and become dehydrated. Freshwater also increases the acidity of the shark's blood, making it difficult for the shark to absorb oxygen. Without an adequate supply of oxygen, the shark will eventually suffocate. Therefore, the shark needs to move to a body of saltwater in order to survive."}
