By the late 1800s, their numbers had dropped to as low as a few hundred animals.\n\nEfforts to protect and conserve the buffalo began in the early 20th century, with the establishment of several national parks and reserves where the animals could be protected from hunting. Additionally, private individuals and organizations began breeding buffalo in captivity and reintroducing them to the wild.\n\nThrough these efforts, the buffalo population has been able to recover and they are now considered to be abundant, with an estimated 500,000 individuals living in North America. However, it is important to note that their population still not reach their historic numbers. Even today, there are still efforts to protect wild buffalo populations and promote the recovery of wild herds.\n\n"}
