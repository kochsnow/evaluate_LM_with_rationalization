Planes need to reach high altitudes to take advantage of the less dense air, which helps with lift and reduces drag. This allows the plane to fly faster and farther. Additionally, the sky provides more room for planes to maneuver and maneuver more safely than if they were to fly lower to the ground. There is less chance of colliding with other planes and objects when flying at a higher altitude. Additionally, the sky is an area with less turbulence and more stable air, which is essential for the safe operation of an airplane."}
