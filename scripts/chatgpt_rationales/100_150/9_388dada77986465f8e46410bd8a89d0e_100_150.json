Airplanes are enclosed spaces where many people are in close proximity to each other for extended periods of time, which can make them an ideal breeding ground for cold and flu viruses. Additionally, airplanes have recirculated air systems that can spread germs more easily than in other enclosed spaces such as buildings or cars. The dry cabin air can also dehydrate the mucous membranes which is making it more vulnerable to cold and flu. Furthermore, many people travel by airplane while they are already sick, which can contribute to the spread of cold and flu viruses. It is a common practice to have a tissue holder in the airplane to prevent passing germs by directly passing on a tissue.\n\n"}
