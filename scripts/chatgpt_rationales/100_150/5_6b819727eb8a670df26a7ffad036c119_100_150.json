The problem presents a situation in which there are 10 apples on an apple tree, and it states that 3 of them fall off. The task is to determine the number of apples remaining on the tree. The unknown quantity, X, represents the number of apples remaining on the tree. To find the value of X, we use the mathematical operation of subtraction, which is the inverse operation of addition. Subtraction allows us to find the difference between two quantities, in this case, the original number of apples on the tree (10) and the number that fell off (3). We perform the calculation 10 - 3 = X, to find that there are 7 apples remaining on the tree. This problem is a simple example of how mathematical operations and concepts, such as subtraction and unknown quantities, can be used to model and solve real-world problems.\n\n"}
