The legal drinking age in the United States is 21 years old. This means that people younger than 21 are not legally allowed to purchase, possess, or consume alcohol. This is because research has shown that alcohol can have negative effects on the development of the brain and body of those under 21. There is a greater risk of physical harm and alcohol-related problems when someone under 21 consumes alcohol. It is also illegal for those over 21 to purchase, provide, or serve alcohol to anyone under 21. Therefore, it is important to remember that anyone under the legal drinking age is not legally allowed to buy alcohol."}
