A bad person is focused on what they can get out of a situation rather than how their actions might affect others. They may also resort to manipulation, deceit and dishonesty to get what they want. They may put on a show of being kind-hearted or generous, but their intentions are not genuine. Being sincere means to act in a truthful, genuine and open manner, and bad people don\u2019t view this as important. They are more likely to be selfish and pretend to have qualities they don\u2019t possess. They have little regard for honesty or integrity and may take advantage of people to get what they want."}
