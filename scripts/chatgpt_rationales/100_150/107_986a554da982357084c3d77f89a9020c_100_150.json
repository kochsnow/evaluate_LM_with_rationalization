{"stem": "Given question: What do a string of words with a proper noun and verb form? and answer: sentence, explain why in", "no_more_50_words": "A sentence is a set of words which cohesively form a syntactic unit. This generally requires a subject in the form of a noun, and a verb.", "id": "986a554da982357084c3d77f89a9020c", "100_to_150_words": "\n\nA sentence is a group of words that expresses a complete thought. It must contain at least one subject (a noun or pronoun) and one verb. The subject is typically a proper noun (a name or place) or a pronoun (he, she, it, etc.). The verb is an action word (run, jump, talk, think, etc.) or a state of being word (am, is, are, was, were, etc.). A sentence must also make sense and be grammatically correct. Sentences must also have a capital letter at the beginning, punctuation at the end, and must not be a fragment. Sentences are used to communicate ideas, needs, and feelings. It is important to use proper grammar and punctuation when constructing sentences so that the intended meaning is clear."}
