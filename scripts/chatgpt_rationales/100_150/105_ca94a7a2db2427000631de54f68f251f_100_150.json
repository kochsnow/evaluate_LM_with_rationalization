By pushing the enemy backwards, the attacking forces would have an easier time controlling the situation and keeping the enemy away. Driving the enemy backwards also ensures that the attacking forces are not caught off guard by any sudden counter-moves or advances by the enemy. In addition, driving the enemy backwards would give the attacking forces more time to regroup, as they could easily fall back to their original positions if the enemy attempted to attack. Finally, driving the enemy backwards would also allow the attacking forces to gain an advantageous position, as they would be able to launch a surprise attack on the enemy while they are in retreat."}
