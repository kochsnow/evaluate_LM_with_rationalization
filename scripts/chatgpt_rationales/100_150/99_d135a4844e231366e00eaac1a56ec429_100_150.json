Like a bicycle, it has one front wheel and one back wheel, each run by a chain.", "id": "d135a4844e231366e00eaac1a56ec429", "100_to_150_words": "\n\nA chain is a common form of power transmission on a motorbike. It is used to transfer power from the engine to the rear wheel of the bike. The chain is connected to two sprockets, one on the engine's crankshaft and one on the rear wheel axle. The teeth of the sprockets mesh together and the engine's power is transferred to the rear wheel, causing it to rotate. This arrangement is much like a bicycle, wherein the pedals are connected to the crank and the crank is connected to the rear wheel via a chain. The motorbike's chain is typically much stronger than a bicycle's, as it must be able to withstand the higher power output of the motorbike's engine. The chain is also often lubricated to reduce friction, minimize wear, and improve its performance."}
