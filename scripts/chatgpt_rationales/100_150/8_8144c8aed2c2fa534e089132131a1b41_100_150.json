Every contestant must wait their turn to sing in order to compete. This is necessary because each contestant needs to be given a chance to showcase their vocal skills and performance. The judges will then evaluate each contestant\u2019s performance and determine who moves on to the next round. Waiting for one\u2019s turn also gives the contestants a chance to prepare for their performance, practice their singing, and ensure that they are ready to deliver the best performance possible. Additionally, the judges must be given enough time to properly evaluate each contestant. This is why all the contestants have to wait their turn to sing in order to be successful on American Idol."}
