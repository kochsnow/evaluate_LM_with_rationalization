This is because when the wind increases, it creates more force which causes the sails to fill up with air. This provides a source of power that propels the ship forward. Windy conditions also create waves, which help to lift the sails and provide additional thrust. Windy conditions also help to reduce the amount of fuel that is needed to power the vessel, making it more efficient. The wind also helps to cool the vessel, which is important when traveling in hot climates. Finally, windy conditions help to keep the ship on its course, as it can provide a steady source of propulsion in one direction. Windy conditions can also create a sense of adventure and excitement, as they provide a challenge that must be navigated in order to reach the destination."}
