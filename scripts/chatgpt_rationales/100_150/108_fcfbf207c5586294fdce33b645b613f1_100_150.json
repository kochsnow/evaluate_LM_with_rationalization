Rain clouds are formed when warm, humid air rises in the atmosphere and cools. As the air cools, it becomes saturated and tiny droplets of water condense onto dust particles in the atmosphere, forming clouds. As the droplets of water get bigger and heavier, they eventually fall from the sky as rain. The water vapor that forms the clouds comes from bodies of water on the Earth's surface. Evaporation from bodies of water, such as oceans and lakes, causes water vapor to rise into the atmosphere. The water vapor is then brought together in the atmosphere by winds and air currents to form clouds. These clouds, when they become saturated with water, eventually bring the water back to the Earth's surface as rain."}
