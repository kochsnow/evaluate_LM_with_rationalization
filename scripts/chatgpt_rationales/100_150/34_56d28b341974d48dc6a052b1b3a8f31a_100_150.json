This was a practical choice, as the tree provided a safe place to rest and take cover from the harsh elements of nature. It also provided a place to store items, hang clothes, and keep warm. The tree's leaves provided shade during the day, while its bark and branches offered protection against the wind and rain. Additionally, the tree was big and strong enough to support a makeshift shelter, which would keep Robinson safe from the dangers of the island. Finally, the tree was a source of food, as Robinson was able to forage for fruit and nuts from its branches and leaves. In short, the huge tree was a valuable resource to Robinson, offering practical, physical, and nutritional benefits."}
