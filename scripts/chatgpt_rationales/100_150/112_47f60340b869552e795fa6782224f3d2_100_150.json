This can be caused by snow becoming heavy, because gravity will pull the snow downward.", "id": "47f60340b869552e795fa6782224f3d2", "100_to_150_words": "\n\nWhen snow on a mountain becomes heavy, it can become unstable and cause avalanches. As snow accumulates, it adds weight to the layers below. The weak layers of snow below can become compressed and unable to support the weight of the snow above, resulting in an avalanche. Avalanches are also caused when the weak layers of snow get disturbed or weakened by strong winds, temperature changes or seismic activity. Once the weak layer of snow gives way, the heavier layers of snow on top will slide down the mountain at high speeds. Avalanches can cause significant destruction to property and lives if they occur in populated areas."}
