The chain is connected to the engine, which is located at the center of the bike and is connected to the rear wheel. The engine provides power to the rear wheel, which is then transmitted through the chain, thus moving the wheel. Chains are more efficient than belts in transferring power from the engine to the wheel and provide a smoother ride. Chains are also more reliable than belts and can last longer if properly maintained. Chains also provide better traction when driving on slippery surfaces, as they have more friction. Finally, chains are easy to repair or replace if they become worn or damaged."}
