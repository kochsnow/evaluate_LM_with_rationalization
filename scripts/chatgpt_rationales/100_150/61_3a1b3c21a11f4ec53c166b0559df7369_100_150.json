{"stem": "Given question: A John is a bum.  Much like the stereotype, he lives near this sort of transportation infrastructure. Where does he live? and answer: bridge, explain why in", "no_more_50_words": "bums are well known to take up residence under bridges.", "id": "3a1b3c21a11f4ec53c166b0559df7369", "100_to_150_words": "\n\nJohn, the bum, is likely to live near a bridge. The bridge provides a sense of security and shelter for a homeless individual, like John. It is often a place to escape the elements and it provides a sense of protection from the outside world. The bridge also allows John to have a spot to sit or sleep, which is difficult to find in most cities. Additionally, a bridge is usually located in an area where there is a decent amount of foot traffic, which provides John with the opportunity to panhandle and make money. Lastly, a bridge is usually located close to public transportation, which allows John to make his way around the city with relative ease. In short, the bridge provides John with all of the necessary amenities to live a comfortable and safe life as a bum."}
