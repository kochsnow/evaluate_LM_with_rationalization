If you need something similar but faster, what would you use? and answer: corvette, explain why in", "no_more_50_words": "Corvettes are very fast cars. Because cars are more lightweight than battleships, they are faster.", "id": "c4494b402264250dc70931613d482295", "100_to_150_words": "\n\nA corvette is a smaller, faster-moving vessel than a battleship. It has a less powerful armament than a battleship, but it is still capable of defending itself, and with its greater speed, it can be used for offensive operations. It is also more versatile than a battleship, as it can be used for convoy protection, reconnaissance, and other missions. It is also more suitable for operations in shallow waters, where a battleship would be too big. Furthermore, it is a less expensive vessel to operate than a battleship, since it requires a smaller crew and less fuel. Finally, its smaller size makes it less visible to an enemy and thus more difficult to target. All these factors make the corvette the ideal choice for situations that require something similar to a battleship, but with greater speed and versatility."}
