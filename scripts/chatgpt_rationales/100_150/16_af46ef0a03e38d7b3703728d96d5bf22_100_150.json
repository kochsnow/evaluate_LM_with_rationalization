Stale air contains pollutants and allergens that can cause breathing problems and fatigue. Fresh air, on the other hand, contains oxygen and other beneficial elements that can help clear the airways and give a sense of mental clarity. Furthermore, being outdoors, even for a short period of time, can help reduce stress and anxiety, and bring a sense of calm. This can be further enhanced by taking part in activities such as walking, running, or simply enjoying the scenery. All of these factors can contribute to feeling refreshed after spending time outdoors."}
