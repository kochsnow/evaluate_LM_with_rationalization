John might need a tissue from the tissue holder to blow his nose for his cold to prevent transmitting germs.", "id": "388dada77986465f8e46410bd8a89d0e", "100_to_150_words": "\n\nJohn might be on an airplane if he asked for a tissue holder because he had a cold. Airplanes can be a breeding ground for germs, and passengers are often stuck in a confined space with limited resources. Therefore, having a tissue holder can be a necessity when flying in order to have easy access to tissues and help minimize the spread of germs. Airlines typically provide tissue holders right before takeoff, so if John asked for one, it's likely that he was on a plane. Additionally, airplanes are one of the few places where tissue holders are common; it's unlikely that he would be asking for one in any other public setting. Therefore, it's possible that John was on an airplane when he asked for a tissue holder."}
