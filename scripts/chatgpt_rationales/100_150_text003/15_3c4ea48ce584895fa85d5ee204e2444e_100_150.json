A bad person is often focused on what they can gain from a situation and will willingly lie, manipulate, and deceive in order to get ahead. They often lack empathy and concern for others, which makes it easier for them to be dishonest and insincere. They may also be motivated by envy and a desire to outdo others and will use any means necessary to accomplish this. Being honest and sincere requires a level of vulnerability and humility that a bad person is unwilling to accept, as it conflicts with their need for power and control. Ultimately, a bad person will not prioritize being honest, acting without pretense or being sincere because it does not benefit them and goes against their own selfish interests."}
