{"stem": "Given question: A car was going from Florida to Ohio, what was it doing? and answer: heading north, explain why in", "no_more_50_words": "Florida is to the south of Ohio, and you need to drive north to go from Florida to Ohio.", "id": "2d5805d894bba224c5fe91e70b8c0f77", "100_to_150_words": "\n\nThe car was heading north because it was traveling from Florida to Ohio. Florida is located in the southeastern United States, and Ohio is located in the midwestern United States. To get from Florida to Ohio, the car would have to head in a northerly direction. If a person were to look at a map of the United States, they would see that Florida is located in the lower right hand corner of the country, while Ohio is located in the upper left hand corner. Therefore, traveling from Florida to Ohio requires traveling in a northerly direction. Additionally, it is likely that the car took an interstate highway, such as I-75, which runs from Florida to Ohio in a mostly northerly direction."}
