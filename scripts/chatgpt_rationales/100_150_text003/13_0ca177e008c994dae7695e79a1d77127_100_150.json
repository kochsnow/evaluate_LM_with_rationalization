This is because people in this state tend to seek out distractions to alleviate their ennui. Going to the bar is one such distraction, as it can provide a variety of stimuli to keep one's attention. There are different kinds of people one can meet at a bar, from the regular patrons to the occasional visitors. Meeting these people can be an exciting experience, as they often have interesting stories to tell and perspectives to share. The conversations one can have with these people can be stimulating and provide a much-needed break from the monotony of everyday life. Furthermore, the atmosphere of a bar can be quite lively, allowing for a sense of community that can be hard to find in other places. In conclusion, boredom can cause people to make decisions that they wouldn't ordinarily make, like going to the bar. While there, they can meet interesting people and partake in conversations that can provide a welcome break from the mundanity of life."}
