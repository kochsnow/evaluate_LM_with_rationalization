Singing is a major part of the show because it is a competition based on the vocal talent of each contestant. Each person must be judged based on their vocal performance, so they must have the opportunity to showcase their talent. The only way to do this is by having the contestants take turns and sing. Each contestant must wait their turn to take the stage and show the judges and audience what they have to offer. This waiting period allows each contestant to prepare themselves for their performance and also gives the judges a chance to get an accurate representation of each individual\u2019s talent. It also allows the audience to feel the anticipation of the upcoming performance and get excited for the next contestant. Waiting one's turn to sing on American Idol is an important part of the competition and ensures that each contestant is judged fairly."}
