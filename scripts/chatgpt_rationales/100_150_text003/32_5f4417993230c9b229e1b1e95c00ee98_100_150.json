This is due to the level of intelligence, creativity and fine motor skills possessed by humans. Driving a car requires the driver to have a strong understanding of the physical laws that govern motion and the ability to make quick decisions while controlling the vehicle. For example, when driving a car, a person must be able to judge the speed and distance of other cars on the road, recognize different signage and signals and make split-second decisions to avoid potential accidents. Additionally, driving a car requires the operation of complex mechanisms that require fine motor skills. Humans are the only species capable of manipulating these mechanisms and making rapid changes to them while driving. This is why humans are the only species that can safely and successfully drive a car."}
