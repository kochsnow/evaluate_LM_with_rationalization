However, with much effort and many years, the buffalo population has been able to recover. Conservation groups and individuals have worked hard to protect the buffalo, implementing a number of initiatives to increase the population. These initiatives include creating and managing protected areas, increasing public awareness of the importance of the species, and reintroducing buffalo into the wild. Additionally, a number of domesticated buffalo have been used to create a large and growing population of buffalo that can be used for commercial purposes. Through these efforts, the buffalo population has not only recovered, but is now abundant. The buffalo has come to symbolize resilience, as it has bounced back to a healthy population despite the threat of extinction. With its population restored, the buffalo can continue to play an important role in the cultural, economic, and ecological life of the United States."}
