{"stem": "Given question: John put something on the night table.  But he forgot about it in the morning because it was unfamiliar. Where was he? and answer: hotel, explain why in", "no_more_50_words": "Hotels are places where people sleep for a few nights when they are travelling, and so it's often the case that hotel guests would be unfamiliar with their room. Given that travellers are unfamiliar with the location, losing items, for example in a night stand, might be more common.", "id": "4a4de5b5ef68561e9a431f75f99063ed", "100_to_150_words": "\n\nJohn was likely staying in a hotel, as this would explain why the item he left on the night table was unfamiliar to him in the morning. Hotels offer a temporary and often unfamiliar living environment, so even if John was staying in a room for several nights, it would be understandable for him to forget about something he had left on the night table. \n\nHotels are often used for short-term stays and provide a variety of amenities. From large lobbies to king-sized beds, these temporary living spaces offer a different experience than a home or apartment. As a result, staying in a hotel can be disorienting and people often forget the details of their surroundings. This may be the case with John, who was likely unfamiliar with the night table and its contents, thus forgetting the item he had placed there. \n\nHotels can also be used for business trips, family vacations, or romantic getaways. In each of these scenarios, people often have to adjust to the unfamiliar environment of a hotel, which can lead to forgetting items left behind. This could have been the case with John, who likely forgot the item he placed on the night table due to the unfamiliarity of the hotel he was staying in."}
