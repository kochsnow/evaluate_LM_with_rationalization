Pain can be physical or emotional. In this case, it is physical pain caused by the bruise. When a person gets injured, their body releases adrenaline and endorphins in response to the pain, which can cause them to yell out in pain. The yelling is an expression of the pain they are feeling in their body.\n\nThe intensity of the pain can vary depending on the severity of the bruise. A minor bruise may cause a person to yell out in mild discomfort, while a more serious bruise may cause a person to yell out in much more intense pain.\n\nPain is a very real experience, and it can be incredibly difficult to deal with. Expressing the pain through yelling is a way to release some of the tension and stress caused by the pain. It can also be a way to alert others to the injury, so they can help.\n\nYelling when you have a bruise is a normal response to pain, and it is an appropriate way to express the intensity of the pain you are feeling. It is important to recognize the pain for what it is and to seek appropriate treatment for any injury."}
