Cats tend to be drawn to residential areas due to the abundance of food, shelter and potential mates. These areas provide cats with suitable living conditions, as they are often close to parks and gardens, where they can hunt and explore, or bask in the sun. In addition, cats are social animals, and they tend to form colonies in residential areas, where they can interact with other cats and establish a sense of community. Furthermore, cats tend to be attracted to human presence, and residential areas are often filled with people, from whom cats can seek attention and affection. Finally, residential areas are often equipped with trash cans and other sources of food, which cats can explore for a meal. All of these factors make residential areas an ideal place for cats to wander and explore, making it the most likely place to find a cat outside."}
