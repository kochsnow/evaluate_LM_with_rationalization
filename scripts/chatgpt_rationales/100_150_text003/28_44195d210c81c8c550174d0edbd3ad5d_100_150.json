It is the first space that people see when they approach the house, and it can be used as an outdoor living area, such as a spot to relax in the sun or to entertain guests. Front yards can also be used to add aesthetic value to the street, by planting trees, shrubs, and flowers. It is also important for safety reasons, as it helps to separate the sidewalk from the house and can provide a buffer zone for vehicles. A front lawn is an important part of a house, and it can add value to the street by providing a well-maintained, attractive area that can be enjoyed by everyone."}
