A building will provide shelter from the cold and rain and a place to dry off. Being in a building will also give the person a chance to warm up. The walls of a building will provide insulation to keep the heat inside, and a heater or fireplace can be used to increase the temperature. Additionally, the person can find dry clothes and blankets to keep warm. Additionally, depending on the structure, the person may be able to access food and drink to help them recover from their cold and wet state. A building is the best option for the person to regain their warmth, dryness, and comfort."}
