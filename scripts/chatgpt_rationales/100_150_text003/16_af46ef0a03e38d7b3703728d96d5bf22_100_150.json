Oxygen helps us to think more clearly, improves our memory, and helps us to think more creatively. Being cooped up indoors for an extended period of time can reduce the amount of oxygen that our bodies receive, which can lead to feeling sluggish and unmotivated. Fresh air also helps to reduce stress levels, as well as helping to reduce headaches and other physical symptoms that can come from being stuck inside. In addition to oxygen, fresh air also contains other elements such as nitrogen, sulfur dioxide, and carbon dioxide, which can help improve our overall health. Fresh air also helps to reduce air pollution, which is beneficial for both our physical and mental health. Spending time outdoors, or even simply opening a window and allowing fresh air to circulate in our homes, can make us feel more refreshed and energized."}
