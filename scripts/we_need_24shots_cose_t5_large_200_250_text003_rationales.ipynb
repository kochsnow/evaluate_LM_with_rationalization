County highways are roads that are maintained and operated by a county or local government, and they are typically used for local travel and transportation within a county or region. On a map, a county highway may be represented as a line, with a specific color or symbol used to indicate its location and route. By viewing a county highway as a line on a map, it is possible to get a sense of the route and layout of the road, and to use the map to plan a journey or navigate to a specific destination.\",\n",
