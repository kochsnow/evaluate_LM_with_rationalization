However, due to the close proximity of patients, the use of shared medical equipment, and the frequent movement of healthcare workers and visitors, hospitals can also be a source of disease transmission. To prevent the spread of disease in hospitals, strict protocols for hand hygiene, disinfection of equipment, and isolation of infected patients are in place.

This relationship between temperature and the state of matter is governed by the laws of thermodynamics and is well understood by scientists and engineers. When the temperature drops to zero, it marks a significant change in the state of matter, and as temperatures continue to decrease, solids will become harder and more brittle. In this context, "drop to zero" refers to the decrease in temperature to the point where matter transitions from a liquid to a solid state.
